    "Jim Halpert":{
        "summary":"James Jim Halpert (born October 1, 1978) is a fictional character in the U.S. version of the television sitcom The Office, portrayed by John Krasinski. The character is based on Tim Canterbury from the original version of The Office. The character is also named after a childhood friend of executive producer Greg Daniels. He is introduced as a sales representative at the Scranton branch of paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin, before temporarily transferring to the Stamford branch in the third season. Upon the merger of Scranton and Stamford branches, he becomes Assistant Regional Manager, and later co-manager alongside Michael Scott during the sixth-season episode arc from The Promotion to Manager and Salesman.",
        "characterization":"Jim Halpert was born on October 1, 1978, to Gerald and Betsy Halpert. He has two brothers; Pete, who lives in Boston, and Tom, who lives in New Jersey. They both share Jim's general love of pranks but have come across as unpleasant and they somewhat bully their little brother. Jim's parents presumably live in Scranton, as well as his sister Larisa and best friend Alan Murphy, who are listed as his emergency contacts at Dunder Mifflin. While Pete and Tom have been seen on the show a few times, Larisa has not.[1] He has a niece, Vanessa,[2] and a nephew old enough to play T-ball.[3] In Branch Wars, while he is not specific on which brother he is referring to, he states that his brother's wife just had another baby.[4] Jim enjoys cycling,[5] and, as he reveals in a deleted scene from Take Your Daughter to Work Day, at times will babysit Toby Flenderson's daughter, Sasha.[6] He also lists soft-shell crab as his favorite food.[7] Jim has noted that basketball Was kind of [his] thing in high school.[8] Although no high school is specifically named by Jim, both Dunmore High School (as evidenced in a deleted scene from Product Recall where, during a business visit, he asks a high school student about a former teacher) and West Scranton High School (as evidenced when, during Email Surveillance, Pam holds up his yearbook displaying their mascot name, Invaders, across the front) are referenced in separate episodes. In the episode Dwight's Speech, Jim tells Dwight that he majored in Public Speaking, however, he later denies this.[9] Jim began working at Dunder Mifflin between 1998 and 1999 (as evidenced in Pilot and The Merger, where Jim says that he still loves when Michael says, Wazzup! crazily after seven years, and that on his first day at work Michael played an orientation video which parodied The Blair Witch Project). In several episodes, it is stated that Jim is a fan of the Philadelphia Phillies, Philadelphia Eagles, and the Philadelphia 76ers. Jim appears to be a fan of hip-hop, specifically Eminem, as Pam mentions him listening to the 8 Mile soundtrack on his iPod in The Delivery. He also appears to like alternative rock, soft rock, and the band Snow Patrol, as Jim uses Open Your Eyes as the background music for the video that he shows to Pam of their past history on the documentary in the episode A.A.R.M. Apparently, he is of Scottish descent, as in Niagara his father can be seen wearing a kilt to Jim's wedding to Pam.[11] In the episode Weight Loss, it is revealed that his screen name for AIM is JIM9334.[3] Like his father, Jim suffers from high blood pressure, as revealed in the episode Pam's Replacement. Though Jim loves to play pranks on Dwight, he is shown to have some things in common with his nemesis, such as a knowledge of comic books and an appreciation for the sci-fi/fantasy genre; as demonstrated in Take Your Daughter to Work Day when Jim and Dwight correct Michael on details about Superman and Aquaman.[12] Despite their frequent conflicts, Jim and Dwight are also shown to be an extremely competent sales team in Traveling Salesmen."

    "Pam Beesly":{
        "summary":"Pamela Morgan Pam Halpert (née Beesly; born March 25, 1979) is a fictional character on The Office, played by Jenna Fischer. Her counterpart in the original UK series of The Office is Dawn Tinsley. Her character is initially the receptionist at the paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin, before becoming a saleswoman and eventually office administrator until she left in the series finale. Her character is shy, growing assertive but amiable, and artistically inclined, and shares a romantic interest with Jim Halpert, whom she begins dating in the fourth season, and eventually, marries and starts a family with as the series continues.",
        "characterization":"The character was originally created to be very similar to the British counterpart, Dawn Tinsley. Even minute details, such as how Pam wore her hair each day, were considered by executive producer, Greg Daniels.[1]When I went in for The Office, the casting director said to me, 'Please look normal', recalls Jenna Fischer. Don't make yourself all pretty, and dare to bore me with your audition. Those were her words. Dare to bore me.[2]Taking heed of the advice, Fischer said little during the auditions, during which she was interviewed in character by show producers, in an improvisational format, to imitate the show's documentary premise. My take on the character of Pam was that she didn't have any media training, so she didn't know how to be a good interview. And also, she didn't care about this interview, she told NPR. So, I gave very short one-word answers and I tried very hard not to be funny or clever because I thought that the comedy would come out of just, you know, the real human reactions to the situation... and they liked that take on it.[2]When I went into the audition, the first question that they asked me in the character of Pam—they said, 'Do you like working as a receptionist?' I said, 'No.' And that was it. I didn't speak any more than that. And they started laughing.[2]Fischer found herself creating a very elaborate backstory for the character. For the first few seasons, she kept a list of the character history revealed on-screen by the creators, as well as her own imaginative thoughts on Pam's history.[3] She created a rule with the set's hair and make-up department that it couldn't look as though it took Pam more than 30 minutes to do her hair,[4] and she formulated ideas as to who gave Pam each piece of jewelry she wore[5] or where she went to college.[5] Fischer also carefully crafted Pam's quiet persona. Well, my character of Pam is really stuck, she explained to NPR. I mean, she's a subordinate in this office. And so, I think that for her, the only way she can express herself is in the silences, but you can say so much by not saying anything.[2]"

    "Dwight Schrute":{
        "summary":"Dwight Kurt Schrute III (born January 20, 1970) is a fictional character on The Office portrayed by Rainn Wilson. He is one of the highest-ranking salesmen as well as the original assistant to the regional manager, (disputed)[2], and former Assistant Regional Manager at the paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin. Additionally, he is a bed-and-breakfast proprietor at Schrute Farms, a beet plantation owner, and an owner of the business park in which Dunder Mifflin exists. He is notorious for his lack of social skills and common sense, his love for martial arts and the justice system, and his office rivalry with fellow salesman Jim Halpert. He is also known for his romantic relationship with Angela Martin, head of the accounting department. He has at times risen to the position of acting Branch Manager of the Scranton branch, but often serves as a second or third in command as Assistant (to the) Regional Manager. While Dwight was a regional manager in the last few episodes of the series, he named himself the Assistant to the Assistant to the Regional Manager (A.A.R.M). Dwight was also the Vice President of Special Projects Development for the Sabre Corporation, which was the parent company of Dunder Mifflin at the time, but was soon replaced by Todd Packer, who was almost immediately terminated. In the final season, Dwight is offered the position of permanent Regional Manager.",
        "characterization":"When the series begins, Dwight Schrute is a competent salesman, despite lacking general knowledge, at the Scranton branch of the paper distribution company, Dunder Mifflin. Dwight formally held the title of Assistant to the Regional Manager,[6] but constantly refers to himself as Assistant Regional Manager, attempting to elevate himself to second-in-command to branch Manager, Michael Scott. (Michael privately makes him Assistant Manager in The Fight, tells him that no record/mention will be kept of the title change only, then never acknowledges it again.) Dwight craves authority over his co-workers and relishes any minor task that Michael or anyone else will give him.[3] Although Dwight acts superior to many individuals and is often resourceful in crises, he is shown to actually be quite gullible, ignorant, and naïve.[3] For this reason, he is easily tricked and pranked by his desk-mate and fellow salesman, Jim Halpert.[7] Dwight often speaks in a halting, intense manner, even in casual conversations.[3] He often uses one-upmanship to better himself over his peers, such as boasting about how he trains specific parts of his body. Dwight will sometimes engage in jokes and games in attempts to please Michael but often fails to do so, because of Michael's perception of himself as the jokester of the workplace. After Dwight temporarily leaves Dunder Mifflin, it is shown that he had long been watering the office plant and arranging the toys on Michael's desk in a manner that made Michael happy, unbeknownst to Michael. Dwight is a former volunteer sheriff deputy,[8] but has to step down after breaking his pledge in order to help his boss, Michael, illegally pass a drug test by giving him his urine in the episode Drug Testing. He is also a notary public; this creates difficulties when Angela desires to send him a notarized letter regarding their break-up. He resides on his family's beet farm, alongside his cousin, Mose. Dwight has affinities for paintball, Battlestar Galactica, ping pong, survivalism, Goju Ryu karate,[9] and weapons. He also has a preference to ride in the back seat of cars behind the driver because it is the safest location in a car. He takes Karate very seriously, gaining a black belt in season 9. He was also Senpai to the Sensei of the Dojo in which he took part in. He is also faster than a Black Pepper snake, known as a speckled kingsnake. In Whistleblower, he is encouraged to invest in real estate by former CEO and owner of Dunder Mifflin-Sabre, Jo Bennett. Dwight decides to purchase the industrial park building where the Scranton branch resides. He has shown entrepreneurial traits, like converting the building lobby into a coffee shop in Nepotism, converting an empty room in the office building into a state-of-the-art gym in Mrs. California, and organizing a barn maze before Halloween where kids can pay admission to play in WUPHF.com. He also owns a plot of land on the light side of the moon, given to him by Andy Bernard in season 8. In an episode commentary on the Season 1 DVD, Wilson refers to Dwight as a fascist nerd. In a feature on the Season 3 DVD, Wilson describes Dwight as someone who does not hate the system, but has a deep and abiding love for it.[10] Wilson also noted that Dwight's personality has the unusual combination of personalities: He enjoys muscle cars and heavy metal music, but is also a science fiction/fantasy nerd.[4]All throughout the series, Dwight drives a maroon 1987 Pontiac Trans Am, until the finale where he owns an orange 2013 Dodge Challenger SRT."

    "Michael Scott":{
        "summary":"Michael Gary Scott (born March 15, 1965) is a fictional character on The Office, portrayed by Steve Carell and based on David Brent from the British version of the program. Michael is the main character of the series, serving as the Regional Manager of the Scranton branch of a paper distribution company, known as Dunder Mifflin Inc. from seasons 1–7. However, he temporarily leaves Dunder Mifflin to form The Michael Scott Paper Company with Pam Beesly and Ryan Howard toward the end of the 5th season and shares a co-managerial position with Jim Halpert during a 6th season arc from The Meeting to Manager and Salesman. In the end of the 7th season, he proposes to HR representative Holly Flax and moves to Colorado to take care of her aging parents, leaving the manager position to Deangelo Vickers in Goodbye, Michael, to Andy Bernard in season 8, and ultimately to Dwight Schrute in season 9.",
        "characterization":"Michael Gary Scott was born March 15, 1965, in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He came from a relatively difficult childhood of loneliness. Michael had some trouble with his early education, shown in Dunder Mifflin Infinity as Michael tells the camera crew he was held back from second-grade. In Diversity Day, Michael claims to be of English, Irish, German, and Scottish ancestry. He also claims to be two-fifteenths Native American. He has mentioned a stepfather, Jeff, whom he despises. In Nepotism, it is revealed that Michael had a half-sister, from whom he was estranged for 15 years. As a consequence of their reunion, Michael hires his nephew Luke as an intern for the office, but eventually confronts the incompetent and rude Luke and ends up spanking him in front of the office, leading Luke to burst into tears and quit. In the episode Take Your Daughter to Work Day, Michael makes the claim that he was a child star on a kids' show called Fundle Bundle; however, it becomes clear that he simply appeared on the show as one of many guest children. In the old recording being played, he speaks touchingly about what he wanted when he grew up: get married, and have 100 kids so he could then have 100 friends and none of them could say no to being his friend. Michael did not attend college, having lost all his tuition money in a pyramid scheme.(The Fire)Michael started at Dunder Mifflin as a salesman in the 1990s.[8] Dwight praised him in a deleted scene from The Coup for winning consecutive awards for the best salesman. In Two Weeks, he claims to have acquired half of the Scranton branch client base. In The Client, he impresses his then-manager, Jan Levinson-Gould, by single-handedly acquiring an important client through somewhat unorthodox methods. Both Pam Halpert and Ryan Howard are impressed watching him make sales and negotiate their contracts when working in The Michael Scott Paper Company. Even Jim Halpert concedes that he might never become as good a salesman as Michael in Koi Pond. During a candid conversation in The Fire, Michael tells Ryan that he became a salesman because he loved to make friends. After being promoted to a regional manager at a young age, he continued to treat work-related relationships as personal friendships. He acknowledges the difficulty because his colleagues are all lower than him in the workplace's hierarchy. He seems to have few relationships outside the office. In his interactions with other characters, Michael is shallow, callous, ignorant and unaware of basic social norms. He tends to overestimate his own importance in the eyes of his coworkers and cannot understand why they do not share his enthusiasm. Michael believes an office should be the place where dreams come true.He is loyal to the company and honestly tries to help his employees when he thinks they are having a problem. Michael has been at Dunder Mifflin (as of Michael's Last Dundies) 9,986,000 minutes, which means that he has been working there since May 6, 1992. Michael's constant desire to be the center of attention often manifests itself in selfish behavior. For example, when he burns his foot in The Injury, he expects Pam and Ryan to tend to his needs, despite Dwight's much more serious concussion. When invited to Phyllis' Wedding, he assumes his participation will be the high point of the ceremony. He pouts when he is upstaged by Phyllis' elderly father, eventually giving an insulting and overly familiar toast that gets him banned from the reception altogether. His desire to be liked often leads him to make unwise decisions or unfeasible promises without considering the consequences, only to back out when they result in an undesirable comeuppance. Michael appears to emphasize moments of sympathy or civility directed at him by his coworkers (mostly Jim) and inflates their importance in order to compensate for his loneliness. Michael is irresponsible with his finances, and at one point is so heavily in debt he has to take up a second job as a telemarketer at the Lipophedrine Diet Pill Company. Though Michael had trouble managing his finances, the majority of his issues came from his girlfriend Jan Levinson, who spends a majority of his money. She even sold their two cars in exchange for a Porsche. Oscar makes a chart of Michael's spending habits and chides him for spending too much money on things nobody ever needs like multiple magic sets and professional bass fishing equipment. Eventually, Michael is forced to declare bankruptcy (which he thinks requires only standing up and shouting I declare bankruptcy!)Due to his overall lack of common sense, Michael can withstand significant abuse from his peers and is often the butt of jokes. He is quick to take offense when wronged and his response is often disproportionate to the harm suffered. Similarly, when he unintentionally offends people, he will apologize. The most notable example of Gay Witch Hunt when he cries after realizing his use of the term faggy hurt Oscar's feelings. Even though he is generally oblivious to criticism, derision and sarcasm, Michael has some limits to his patience, and leaves to question the extent of offense that he can actually acknowledge (demanding professional respect from Stanley Hudson in Did I Stutter? or standing up to the employees in favor of Holly in Business Ethics). In The Meeting, it is shown Michael does not aim for his employees' betterment or his own, thinking that this would put his job in jeopardy. He unwittingly turns down a promotion that would put Jim in his position, choosing the status quo over his employees' ambitions. He sabotages Jim with a bad recommendation, mistakenly believing Jim's promotion would lead to his firing. He does, however, concede to a co-managerial position with Jim to avoid losing him. Related to this, Michael tends to express disdain towards those who he feels challenge his authority, the most notable being Toby. He has also expressed issues with Gabe in Viewing Party and Charles in New Boss. All three instances cause him to throw immature spiteful tantrums towards said person. Being a lifelong hopeless romantic, Michael has had several romantic relationships, most notably with Jan who had become too domineering over him thus forcing him to end their relationship. He eventually settled with Holly as she shared a similar sense of humor with him. He eventually quit Dunder Mifflin and moved to Boulder, Colorado to help her care for her ailing parents. They got married and had four kids together, while Governor John Hickenlooper appointed him as Director of Paper Distribution in the Department of Natural Resources.Apart from his masterful salesmanship, Michael is lacking in almost any other skills, management or otherwise. Jim Halpert once made a color graph of how Michael spends his time: 80% distracting others; 19% procrastination; and 1% critical thinking. Jim added that he inflated the critical thinking percentage so people could actually see it on the graph. His laid-back approach more often results in lower than expected workplace productivity, particularly when Michael places personal interests as a priority over work (such as his birthday, someone else's birthday, or his various seminars). To avoid being disciplined for his foolish actions, Michael often resorts to scapegoating employees to cover himself. Although his actions often lead to more problems for his employees, Michael believes that Scranton is the cool, fun branch... like Animal House. He is genuinely upset when the top salesman from the Utica office trashes Scranton in a phone call by saying it's worse than Camden. Although his position as Regional Manager gives him broad decision-making authority on branch operations, he often places those responsibilities secondary to his desire to be friends with his employees. On the other hand, he also oversteps his authority by hosting events that Corporate disapproves of, such as The Dundies and a booze cruise. It is revealed in the episode The Duel that the Scranton branch is the best-performing company branch, well ahead of Utica and Nashua. Michael is called to corporate headquarters to answer the question, What are you doing right? After several minutes of Michael's inarticulate babble, his superiors concede that while Michael is definitely doing something right, they will probably never know exactly what. They send him on a lecture tour to spread his wisdom; instead, he wastes time and annoys the workers who have to listen to his drivel. Despite his ineptitude, Michael is prone to brief bouts of surprising insight and is shown to have a kind heart as he shows deep, family-like affection towards the people working in the Scranton branch. The staff initially finds Michael annoying but he grows on them and is given emotional goodbyes during his final days in Scranton. In the episode Broke, Michael displays self-awareness of his inability to keep secrets when he, Pam and Ryan all agree not to let Dunder Mifflin know the Michael Scott Paper Company is broke. Moments later he is seen bent over and in a panic when he admits that he's afraid he won't be able to keep himself from letting the truth slip. In the same episode, he displays a remarkable ability to negotiate with Dunder Mifflin and convince the company to hire himself as well as Pam and Ryan back with full benefits. In the episode Murder, Jim attempts to confront Michael for wasting time when he has the staff participate in a murder-mystery role playing game. However, he is confronted by an unusually serious and stern Michael, who demands to, just let them [the staff] have this game. Jim then realized Michael actually was trying to distract the staff from the possibility of losing their jobs after a news article hinted at Dunder Mifflin going bankrupt.Apart from his masterful salesmanship, Michael is lacking in almost any other skills, management or otherwise.

    "Ryan Howard":{
        "summary":"Ryan Bailey Howard is an American salesman, former receptionist, and convicted fraudster who works at Dunder Mifflin. He was a temporary employee until he is promoted as Vice President of Sales. However, David Wallace demotes him when the Michael Scott Paper Company is acquired by Dunder Mifflin. He also worked at the Michael Scott Paper Company until the acquisition. Ryan was convicted of fraud for misleading the shareholders of Dunder Mifflin, and was arrested. However, he was released and required to do community service. He is portrayed by the show's writer, director, and executive producer B. J. Novak, and is based upon Ricky Howard from the original British version of The Office (as well as Neil Godwin, during the fourth season). During this time, his role is significantly expanded to that of a main character.",
        "characterization":"Little is known about Ryan Howard's early life, but it is revealed in a deleted scene from Diversity Day that he grew up in Scranton and attended Penn State University. In the webisode The Story of Subtle Sexuality, Ryan mentions that his parents live in separate houses. At the beginning of the series, Ryan Howard is a temporary employee at the Scranton branch of the fictitious paper distributor Dunder Mifflin who joined the staff in the first episode, earning him the nickname The Temp. In early episodes, he is shown to be uncomfortable with his professional relationship with his boss, Michael Scott. Michael often forces Ryan to carry out menial tasks for him while at the same time, becoming obsessed with Ryan's personal life as well as gaining Ryan's friendship. As the series progresses, Ryan begins to display a great deal of contempt and disdain for both his coworkers and his job. This becomes more apparent when Ryan is promoted in The Job to work at Dunder Mifflin's corporate office in New York. This leads to Ryan becoming an egotistical braggart despite lackluster sales skills. In the season 4 finale Goodbye, Toby, Ryan is arrested for committing fraud. He is eventually released and required to work community service. In the season 5 premiere, Ryan returns to the Scranton branch after Michael arranges for him to work Pam's job. However, his malevolent aspirations to climb back to the top of the corporate ladder are revealed when he adds Jim and Kevin to a list of people who will be sorry when he returns to the top. In a deleted scene, he would add Dunder Mifflin CFO David Wallace to that list after Wallace called and became irate upon learning of Ryan's return to the Scranton branch. Ryan was a member of a fraternity in college and holds an MBA from the University of Scranton's Kania School of Management, which he earned during the second and third seasons. His dream is to one day own his own business. Throughout the series, Ryan changes his persona every year beginning with the third season. When offered a job for Corporate in the season 3 finale, Ryan relocates to New York City and adopts a nouveau riche persona: becoming extroverted, growing a beard, wearing nice suits, and getting $200 haircuts. But he subsequently ends up partying hard and getting addicted to drugs and alcohol. His downfall culminates in misleading Dunder-Mifflin's shareholders via his website's sales numbers, effectively committing fraud as Oscar Martinez later claims. In season 5, he returns with blonde highlights and a work hard, plays hard attitude. He works for Michael at the Paper Company and still tries to keep his work ethic and strive to do good. In seasons 6–8, Ryan seems to be devoid of many of his former morals and ambitions. He does not care to work, reads poetry, and initiates various creative projects. He switches clothing, from wearing fanciful scarves, fake glasses, suspenders, bow ties, trench coats, etc. and tries to create an unsolvable attitude. He stays at Dunder Mifflin, but his position is unspecified; Michael mentions that he works there full-time in WUPHF.com. Many of the staff, most notably Jim and Pam, note Ryan's ineptitude as an employee and that he sponges off his parents by living with them and driving his mom's car."

    "Jan Levinson":{
        "summary":"She serves as the main antagonist in the first two seasons, a major character-turned-main antagonist of season 3, the secondary antagonist in Season 4, a supporting antagonist in Seasons 5 and 9, and a minor character in Season 7. Her counterpart in the UK version is Jennifer Taylor-Clarke. She is portrayed by Melora Hardin. At the start of the show, she is the Vice President of Northeast Sales at the paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin, directly supervising central character and Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch, Michael Scott. Her character is notable for the dysfunctional relationship she enters with Michael following the second-season episode, The Client, until the fourth-season episode Dinner Party. Michael and Jan's personas contrast to much humor in the series, particularly in their professional attitudes and social interactions, although Jan's erratic and sexually-domineering state of mind leads to the loss of her job.",
        "characterization":"At the start of the show, Jan Levinson-Gould, as Vice President of Sales at Dunder Mifflin, has a no-nonsense management style that is at odds with Michael's more casual approach. Since her office is in New York, Jan's contact with the Scranton branch is largely by telephone, although she will make the two-and-a-half-hour drive to Scranton if necessary. She usually asks if she's on camera when talking to Michael on the speaker phone, and Michael often lies and tells her she is not, before admitting that they are—at which point she hangs up on him. While initially based on Jennifer Taylor-Clarke from the UK version, her character develops in a different direction. Although married at the start of the show, Jan becomes divorced and drops Gould from her last name in The Client. Jan had entered into the marriage knowing that her husband didn't want to have children, and that disagreement was a contributing factor to their divorce. (The Client) She has mentioned seeing a psychiatrist, as well as having been a victim of identity theft. (Back From Vacation). In a deleted scene from Dinner Party, it is implied that Jan grew up in West Virginia. The Serenity by Jan website indicates that she had an unhappy childhood and ran away from home, and she once said that her family refused to speak to her anymore on advice of counsel. She initially drives a Volvo S80 and Volvo S60, and trades it in with Michael's Sebring for a shared Porsche Boxster. However, she is seen in season five with a Toyota Highlander. She smokes in stressful situations and indulges in self-destructive tendencies with poor judgment in spite of her inherent competence and professional attitude. She demonstrates a strong and often fetishist sexuality which sometimes intimidates Michael, such as when he revealed in Women's Appreciation that Jan did not always abide by their safety word foliage. It is implied that she may have taken the virginity of her assistant, Hunter, of whom Michael is jealous. Jan has also been shown to be rather vain, creating musical media to supposedly express love for Astrid but rather seems an attempt to flaunt her performance skills, whilst also acting smug about her parenting in Pam's presence."
