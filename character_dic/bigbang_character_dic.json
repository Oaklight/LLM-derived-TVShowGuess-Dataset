    "Sheldon Cooper":{
        "summary":"Dr. Sheldon Lee Cooper, B.Sc., M.Sc., M.A., Ph.D., Sc.D., is a pathetic Caltech theoretical physicist. Next to his best friend Leonard Hofstadter, he’s the main protagonist of The Big Bang Theory and the titular protagonist of Young Sheldon. Originally from East Texas, Sheldon started college at the age of 11, receiving his first Ph.D. at the age of 16. As a kid, Sheldon was involved in numerous experiments as a wunderkind, such as his plan to provide free electricity for his hometown by building a nuclear reactor - a plan that government pen-pushers stopped, claiming that it is illegal to store yellowcake uranium in a garden shed. Proudly geeky, he has no qualms about speaking Klingon, wearing vintage t-shirts sporting super-hero logos, or spouting various historical and cultural anecdotes (e.g., his account of the introduction of the fork into Thailand). While he may claim to be the perfect human specimen, Sheldon does have his faults. Sheldon is characterized by a strict adherence to routine and hygiene, an overly intellectual personality, a tenuous understanding of irony, sarcasm and humor, and a general lack of humility or empathy, the former of which is demonstrated in the fact that he has no problem voicing to his peers his admiration for his superior intellect. These qualities, along with his penchant for pranks, are his character's main source of humor. He is often considered to be the most iconic character of the show. Sheldon has developed a more sociable personality due to the influences of his friend Penny and his wife Amy but some of it does not always show up.",
        "characterization":"Aside from his characteristic idiosyncrasies, unpragmatic obsessions and extreme narcissism, Sheldon believes humans are illogical and attempts to be logical himself. [Even though, in reality, he's actually significantly more illogical than most people in so many ways (i.e.; fear of change, fear of birds, expecting others to change for him, throwing childish tantrums, being immature etc.)] He frequently states that he possesses an eidetic memory although the correct term for this type of recall is hyperthymesia (highly superior autobiographical memory) He also states that he has an IQ of 187, though he claims his IQ cannot be accurately measured by normal tests (further confirming his egotism). Sheldon has a generally excessively extensive knowledge of most philosophical principles of certain topics of interest, as shown, for example, by his comments about various details of anecdotal knowledge (for instance, about the introduction of the fork into Thailand). He can remember everything he's exposed to. It was also revealed in The Sales Call Sublimation that Sheldon, possibly, has synesthesia. He told Raj that he automatically sees prime numbers as red and that twin primes appear pink and smell like gasoline. These are characteristics of people with synesthesia. Sheldon also has qualities associated with being a prodigy, such as an inflated ego, social ineptitude, and an inability to relate emotionally with other people. Despite his intelligence, he has a distinct lack of emotional maturity and is often baffled by even the most common social interactions. He not only fails to understand the simplest sarcastic jokes made by his friends but also regards their sadness over problems with blatant confusion. Eventually he has begun to understand the concept of sarcasm, attempting unsuccessfully to employ it himself towards Penny in the second season, and successfully employing it towards his other friends in the third season. He appears to have a complete disinterest in romantic relationships, and his eccentricities, direct remarks and demanding nature put him at odds with his own friends and especially Penny. For a few years he also showed a disinterest in being romantic with Amy. Up until The Empathy Optimization, Sheldon never seemed to have any sense of remorse or guilt. Perfect examples of this include when he ratted out Leonard, Raj and Howard for inappropriate sexual behavior to Human Resources, just because he thought he did nothing wrong (when, in reality, he talked to his assistant about sexually transmitted diseases) and when he puts down Amy by not treating her accomplishments like they were a big deal. Sheldon is extremely arrogant, narcissistic, selfish, and utterly self-righteous. According to Sheldon's Meemaw, it's strongly implied that Sheldon takes after his grandfather, Pop-pop, who was known for being a stubborn, egotistical man. When the group find an actual prop of the One Ring from The Lord of the Rings Sheldon immediately snatches it off Howard, bluntly declaring Mine! and when people protest to this, he moans I don't understand why, in this group, I never get my way!, completely oblivious to the fact that he always gets his way - through coercion, bullying or genuinely interfering with or ruining other people's lives til he gets his way. When he doesn't get the Ring, he constantly tries to retrieve it, to the point of invading his own friends' privacy and boundaries and effectively stealing it off them (e.g.; he tried to steal it off Penny while she was sleeping, only resulting in her reflexively punching him and breaking his nose and later pickpocketing Leonard while he was relieving himself in the men's room). This particular example shows that his great love for a fictional movie or rights cause him to be extremely obsessed with things that don't really matter in the context of the real world. In conclusion, it can be axiomatically ascertained that Sheldon will try to achieve, retrieve or maintain anything if it meant that he would seem (fictionally or genuinely) superior to everyone else. Sheldon adheres to The Roommate Agreement constantly when things don't go his way and interestingly, Sheldon's styled the roommate agreement so that everything goes his way. Sheldon Also officiates in said agreement that he settles all ties, increasing the likelihood that he gets what he wants. That being said, when a clause of the Roommate Agreement applies to him to not do something, he will treat it like it's ridiculous - in the process, hypocritically violating the agreement despite constantly chiding Leonard when he apparently violates it. At one point, when Leonard headed a project for the group, Sheldon labelled him as simply the founder, while he was chief or head of absolutely everything else, making him in charge. He also tried to make the project named after himself, even trying to get by naming the project with his name spelt backwards. Sheldon is revealed by Priya to have repeatedly violated the roommate agreement, and the several demonstrations of this cause deep discomfort and even despair in Sheldon, who becomes vengeful and deliberately damages Leonard and Priya's relationship through blackmail afterwards. Sheldon does not see fault in absolutely anything he does in his life, to such an extent that he doesn't think that, when he commits a serious crime, he is doing anything wrong. He, at one point, insulted a judge while in court, simply because of his belief that his job and status was superior to the judge's, which landed him in jail for his trouble. Sheldon also stalked President Siebert just to get a simple answer out of him, to the point of following him to his home and then calling him anonymously. Sheldon is willing to steal to get what he wants, and bully anybody to do so as well. A prime example is when he deliberately puts all of Penny's clothes on the telephone wires without acknowledging, or even probably noticing, that this was outright bullying of somebody without any moral reasons other than self-righteousness and phenomenal delusions of authority on his part. When he finds out he's wrong, he just replies, Oh! and doesn't apologize. He sees it as his absolute right to interfere with something that has nothing to do with his business, and alter it so that it benefits or pleases him, shown at one point when he interfered with Leonard's dating another woman despite it not concerning him at all. Another example is when Penny, after an argument with Leonard which upsets Sheldon, says that this really isn't about you, his only (strained) response - after a very long pause - is I don't follow, showing that he doesn't understand why he cannot be priority one in situations that has nothing to do with him. Sheldon also doesn't realize at all that he's an immense burden to everyone around him due to his controlling, condescending, and demoralizing behavior - he rather sees himself as a true privilege to his friends simply out of egomania.Sheldon is openly pompous and condescending towards people like Howard, treating him like a simpleton - to say the least - constantly. His incredible sense of pomposity is so widespread that he immediately places himself in a position of absolute power, credit, benefit, or authority in whatever project, ambition, or situation which is discussed within earshot of him. He will also meet every single opposition to his authority with immense melodrama - he describes Leonard's control of one notable project as 'Leonard's reign of tyranny', despite being a dictator himself. He's also completely taken off guard when he is excluded from the project, because he's absolutely incapable of seeing anything he's done as a bad thing.Sheldon is pompous and incredibly entitled, conceitedly picturing himself as either/or a mentor, teacher, father-figure, sensei, commander, superior and director simply out of intense self-delusion. He does not do any amount of personal labor if he could avoid it, shown by how he is seen with Howard and Raj both carrying huge workloads of Christmas presents, whilst he is only carrying a small cylindrical present in one hand and eating an ice cream cone with the other. He appears completely indifferent, if not apathetic, to the fact that they are on the edge of collapsing from exhaustion and could be crushed under the weight. Another supreme example is when he realizes that Amy is going to work at the same university as he is, and says You can't work where I work, thinking that he has complete jurisdiction over where she works.Another key example of Sheldon's selfishness is when he's ill. Sheldon demands that everyone else take care of him, even if they're occupied with other tasks or could be hurt or ill themselves due to never having been ill alone before. He also believes that being ill entitles him to be rude to others as shown during The Empathy Optimization, Sheldon was completely ungrateful and insulting to his friends and did not realize this until Leonard made him remember.Though not confirmed, Sheldon appears to have extreme megalomaniacal tendencies. When he was a child, the kind of pet he wanted would be one that was capable of killing at telepathic command. He also, at several points in his childhood, tried to build devices and technologies that would enable him to kill or avenge himself on people who had done him wrong. At several points in his life, he fantasizes about rising to power, gaining a planet that he can rule with an iron fist, even declaring that he will, one day, have a robot army at his disposal. In addition to this, Sheldon constantly brags that he will, one day, gain a Nobel Prize and suggests to several people that their contributions to his life will earn them a mention in his memoirs (entitled You're welcome, mankind). He also sees himself as a world-renowned physicist with an unparalleled understanding of the universe and that he's on the precipice of advancing mankind's understanding of the universe, ignoring the fact that there are some aspects of even science that he has some lack of understanding of, and he is notoriously able to make scientific mistakes - he was rendered absolutely speechless by an equation in a physics bowl which he didn't know the answer to, and was so angry that he couldn't figure it out that he denied the correct answer when it was provided. What this means generally is that he believes that mankind owes him big time, and has done so his entire life.Sheldon's opinion of his own profession is overly ego-oriented, to the point where, if he sees any occupation of someone else's that's unrelated to his, he tacitly and implicitly admonishes them and boasts about his own. This is exemplified by his extremely low opinions of Howard's profession as an engineer (he constantly scorns Howard's intellect based on him not having a Ph.D. and the fact that he's an engineer), his belief that geology is the Kardashians of science and his discredited opinions of biology as a low point on the scientific ladder simply on the basis that it is, in his own words, all about disgusting, squishy things. However, despite scorning engineering as unimportant, he is shown to be somewhat extremely knowledgeable in the subject himself in terms of general knowledge (certainly not field work) and therefore only condescends the subject because he finds the information and premise inferior to that of physics. Sheldon has remarked that it is his dream to be an astronaut, and that he was secretly stunned at Howard being chosen to go into space, stating in his own words that it showed him they'd just send 'anyone' up there.Sheldon's expression of his more advanced intelligence has gotten him fired from his job, and even Leonard is surprised to learn that Sheldon is conceited enough to believe that Isaac Newton is intellectually inferior to himself. Sheldon hates it when someone stops him when he is trying to explain something. If he is, a violent tic starts on his face until he can complete what he wants to say, as in The Friendship Algorithm when he is prevented from explaining why tapioca pudding is a jiggling bowl of potential death. He cannot and will not drive, and thus someone must always drive him, unless in an extreme circumstance (like when he drives Penny to the emergency room in The Adhesive Duck Deficiency.Sheldon has done some questionable things, such as when he discovered that Penny's apartment was messy, he sneaks in during the night and cleans it up because he can't stand being in the same hallway with something so disastrous. He refuses to sit anywhere other than his designated spot on the couch and follows set routines. A running gag of the show is that, when he knocks on Penny's door, he has to say Penny's name every three knocks (he does this thrice every time). It was never specified by the series creator why Sheldon does those things.Sheldon occasionally uses slang (in a very unnatural fashion), and follows jokes with his catchphrase Bazinga! He is not entirely sure how to hug someone, and he avoids human contact whenever possible. Despite his ego-centrism, Sheldon appears to be somewhat aware of his social ineptitude, particularly his lack of understanding of sarcasm. He mentioned that he keeps a record of his daily conversations after Penny snapped at him and Leonard asked him why, to which he suggested that Leonard check his conversation records to see if I messed up anywhere. Sheldon is also a difficult person to work with and generally displays apathy to the world around him. In The Toast Derivation, Sheldon was revealed to have criticized Bill Gates for focusing on his charity work rather than Windows Vista, a remark that earned him a punch in the face.Sheldon also possesses some understanding of other religions such as Hinduism and corrects Rajesh when he says cows are gods, when they are actually like gods, and was also knowledgeable about other Hindu beliefs. However despite being raised in an extremely religious household, Sheldon possesses no faith in Christianity. Even after moving back to Texas, he planned to teach the religious types evolution and only moved back to Pasadena when his mother calls evolution opinion. Sheldon deems karma as nonsense and was left baffled when Rajesh deescribed it as Newtonian. Sheldon is extremely germaphobic and is extreme in his methods to avoid catching an illness, such as sterilizing his mouth with whiskey after sipping from Leonard's glass. Sheldon does his best to avoid any human contact; however, as the series continues he became more (albeit only slightly) affectionate person, such as when he hugged Leonard after he returned from Professor Proton's funeral and kissed Amy on board a locomotive. He does not mind Amy touching as their relationship progresses.Sheldon does, on rare occasions, show interest in relationships, which was most prominently seen with Amy Farrah Fowler. However, he does not express it directly; instead, he develops strange behavior patterns, such as buying cats, refusing to open discussion on the matter. Despite this, however, Sheldon remains completely clueless to the sexual innuendos which were present during his and Amy's anniversary when she became intoxicated, causing her to unbutton her blouse and asking that they skip to dessert, for Sheldon to reply I just had cobbler. This was also evident when their upstairs neighbor hooked up with the producer of CSI and, while the two are having intercourse, he mistakes it for her jumping up and down on the bed. However, there's one situation where he may have understood an innuendo. When Raj, Leonard, Howard, and Sheldon were competing over The One Ring and Penny appears with a bag from Victoria's Secret, Sheldon and the rest all look at Leonard. He either understood what Penny meant or was looking because everyone else was. Eventually, he does have coitus with Amy but it's only cause that's what she'd want for her birthday. Afterwards, he admits that he enjoyed more than he thought he would."

    "Leonard Hofstadter":{
        "summary":"Dr. Leonard Leakey Hofstadter, Ph.D., is an experimental physicist at the California Institute of Technology who formerly roomed with Sheldon Cooper in Apartment 4A. Now he and his wife Penny live in that apartment. They also formerly lived in Penny's (now Sheldon and Amy's) apartment Apartment 4B. He is one of the main male protagonists of The Big Bang Theory. Originally from New Jersey, Leonard attended Princeton University and was twenty-four years old when he received his doctorate with a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics. Having lived with Sheldon for 1 decade as of Season 6, he and Leonard are best friends; however, Leonard can become very agitated by many of his eccentricities and often feels obligated to explain Sheldon's behavior and serve as a mediator between him and other people in situations – he's been described as the straight man of the series. While Leonard, along with his geek friends and fellow scientists, is somewhat socially inept, Leonard would like to be better accepted outside of his social group. Leonard is better-adjusted than his companions, being more willing to try different things. He appears to be best suited as a leader of the group, with Sheldon commenting how Leonard is the Kirk of their landing party. The romance between him and neighbor Penny, with their on-and-off relationship has been the major force for drama until Shamy started.",
        "characterization":"Although Leonard feels at home with his geek colleagues, he is reluctant to let others know about his recreational activities (such as Klingon Boggle), as he does not like to be seen as a geek and wants to be more social. Sweet, thoughtful, kind, intelligent, mature, sardonic and socially awkward, but well-meaning, Leonard also seems to be the most well-adjusted and sensible one of The Social Group, and is quick to try new things apart from his geek friends. Despite his reasonable nature, he can sometimes display selfishness, normally putting his needs before his friends' well-being, as told by Sheldon Cooper who is the only one to realize this. During the group's expedition to North Pole he tricks Sheldon into thinking that he had definitively proven slow moving magnetic monopoles when in reality it was simply static from him switching the electric can opener on and off as he they wanted to kill Sheldon. When they return from the North Pole he is totally humiliated among his scientific peers. Sheldon fled to Texas to live with his mother, Leonard, despite the trick being his idea, wanted Raj and Howard to go to Texas without him to convince Sheldon to come back, just so that he could have first sex with Penny (The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation). Another example is when he refuses for Zack Johnson to be Superman for the comic book store's costume party because Zack has actual muscles (The Justice League Recombination). Another example of Leonard's selfishness was when he was sleeping with Raj's sister Priya, and didn't seem to care how Raj felt about the situation (The Cohabitation Formulation). A lifetime of being denied and refused praise and acclaim that he unavoidably deserves (Because his mother had absolutely little regard or admiration for him and often demolished his infrequent moments of happiness as a child, and Sheldon relentlessly unknowingly demoralizes him and his accomplishments out of egomania and sheer apathy) has led to Leonard yearning for recognition for his intelligence, compassion and determination. He becomes extremely bitter when he discovers that a major science paper that he and Sheldon cooperatively wrote was published with only Sheldon's name (which was obviously Sheldon's fault due to Sheldon being an arrogant credit hog). He also admits to Sheldon that he is an egotist who needs his big ego to be constantly validated from people who are much less smarter than he is while presenting their paper to a class of graduate students. As a result of how he was raised (Unloved and under-appreciated, due to the lack of love from his parents, his mother's views of raising children as obviously opposed to his father's), he was not as intelligent as his siblings and his mother having been unloving, unsupportive and neglectful altogether and treating Leonard as a personal science experiment instead. Leonard was seen as not any happier than Sheldon (who grew up loved) and frequently insecure and sometimes unhappy. But that soon changed during his second relationship with Penny. She made him more confident during their relationship (Since Penny always gave him lots of love and affection and Leonard was only in love with her the day they first met) and by the time they were married, Leonard was much happier than he had ever been in his life, having married the love of his life, as said by Amy and Bernadette in The Separation Oscillation (even his mother thought that perhaps she was wrong that they shouldn't be together due to Penny's education status, but when she saw how happy Leonard had been since their marriage, which she had never seen before, she thought they were a good couple together). Among the main characters, he generally has the least amount of difficulty interacting with ordinary individuals, as compared to Sheldon (who is unable to grasp social norms), Raj (who is unable to talk to women outside his family unless under the influence of alcohol until the end of season 6), and even Howard (who is often seen as creepy when flirting with women) since Leonard is the only one of them interested and quite adept in building interpersonal and social relationships with other people. Compared to his friends, he is also relatively the most successful with women. Between Sheldon and him, Leonard is the only one who feels that he should do something when Penny begins to recount her recent breakup. Leonard usually blurts out the wrong things in front of women when he is nervous, such as when he's trying to invite Penny to lunch and mentions that curry is a natural laxative, or, as in The Plimpton Stimulation where he can't decide what to say he will often combine thoughts. i.e. Hi-lo, instead of Hi, or Hello. Despite his attempts to reject his geek status, Leonard owns, among other things, Star Wars hygiene products, an expensive Superman comic book collection, a Battlestar Galactica Colonial warrior's flight suit, and a light saber that he calls a glow stick. Leonard is indicated to be proficient in literature, history, and music as well as the sciences - he is able to solve a woman's crossword puzzle in a matter of seconds (the answers were mostly literary in nature) and he can play the cello. Having lived with Sheldon for many years, they are best friends, and he is obligated to explain Sheldon's irrational behavior and serve as a mediator between him and other people in many situations; however, Leonard often gets very irritated by much of his behavior. For instance, when Penny and Sheldon engaged in a fierce dispute, Leonard gave Penny the phone number of Sheldon's mother so she would call her son and scold Sheldon for his behavior, thus ending the fight, as shown in the episode The Panty Piñata Polarization. Leonard is also upset that Sheldon dislikes his favorite show, Babylon 5, which Sheldon refuses to allow to be watched in his apartment. Like everyone, he dislikes his friend's habit of rattling off different trivial facts. Leonard's IQ of 173 is not as high as Sheldon's and the latter has scoffed at Leonard's whiteboard theories as common enough to be scribbled on the wall of every men's room at MIT. Leonard seems to get along well with Howard. Leonard and Howard even have a Girlfriend Pact, which Leonard invoked in The Desperation Emanation so that Howard would help him get a girlfriend. In The Peanut Reaction, Howard tried to make Leonard's birthday a surprise, going as far as getting himself hospitalized, proving to Leonard how much Howard cares for him though Penny also proposed him the phone number of one of her slutty friends. Leonard also seems to get along well with Raj. Although Leonard does get irritated by much of Raj's impulsive and eccentric behavior, as in The Griffin Equivalency where Raj became pompous and self-absorbed after being chosen to be in People magazine. Leonard has a lot of conditions. He is lactose intolerant, asthmatic, bespectacled due to myopia, prone to carsickness and migraines, gets a bloody nose after jogging, suffers from sleep apnea, allergies and a lot of ear infections, and possesses a genetic predisposition to heart disease. Leonard's primary health concern is his lactose intolerance. He avoids eating even small amounts of dairy products (including cheese, yogurt and butter), as well as melon and desserts at The Cheesecake Factory, for fear of his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal and resulting in the emission of a noxious gas that Sheldon maintains can be weaponized. This digestive trait is often the subject of teasing. According to the pilot episode, he cannot process corn either. Leonard is somewhat neurotic, insecurely tilting his head as he speaks nervously, as well as avoiding eye contact and squinting. When under great stress, his voice is elevated to a high-pitched whine, when he lies or gets sweaty. At times, Leonard's demeanor seems very low energy and somewhat irritable. Clumsy, he often bangs his head, which induces vomiting. Leonard is incredibly sensitive about his height (he stopped growing in eighth grade), although he enjoys pointing out that Howard is shorter. Leonard is usually seen wearing his characteristic black-framed glasses, neutral-colored jackets or vests over a hoodie, low-cut black Converse sneakers, brown trousers, and physics-themed t-shirts. Along with his fashion choices, including mismatched color schemes, he sometimes applies an absurd amount of hair gel; however, his girlfriends often buy him new clothes, and he has put aside his corduroy suit for formal occasions to don a fancy silk shirt and vest or blazer, much to Penny's approval. His formal suits style improves with time. He always wears his hoodies because Sheldon has the thermostat set so low. Over the course of the series, despite retaining his geeky habits, Leonard's confidence has grown and he has become more socially adept throughout the series. Leonard is also somewhat charismatic and a good leader in certain situations, which Sheldon shockingly recognizes."

    "Penny Hofstadter":{
        "summary":"Penny, is a fictional character on the American CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory, portrayed by actress Kaley Cuoco. She is the primary female character in the series. She lives in Apartment 4A with her husband Leonard Hofstadter across the hall from Sheldon Cooper and Amy Farrah Fowler who live in apartment 4B where Penny used to live. Her full first name is possibly Penelope as implied by The Barbarian Sublimation, as her username was Queen Penelope. She was unknowingly married to her ex-boyfriend Zack Johnson for three years, so her name could include Johnson. That marriage was finally annulled in The Thanksgiving Decoupling.",
        "characterization":"When she first met the guys in the Pilot, Penny was writing a screenplay about a girl from Lincoln, Nebraska who travels to Los Angeles at the age of 18 to become an actress, but ends up working at The Cheesecake Factory instead. When Leonard asks if the screenplay was autobiographical, she replies that it isn't, because she is from a small town outside of Omaha, Nebraska. Penny moved into the apartment building because she split with Kurt, her boyfriend for 4 years. She says she still loved him, and insinuates he cheated on her. The shower in her apartment was broken at the time, so the boys offered her theirs. Her apartment is sloppy and disorganized, but Penny appears to like it that way. She is either oblivious to or completely aware of her effect on the boys, because within minutes of meeting him, she asked Leonard to retrieve her television set from Kurt's apartment, which he immediately set out to do. Penny is aware of Leonard's crush on her, and it is hinted throughout the series that some of the feelings are reciprocated. At the end of season one, Penny goes on a date with Leonard. Leonard is nervous, and Penny slightly withdrawn, but they share a kiss. In season two, there was some initial enthusiasm between Penny and Leonard; however, they later develop insecurities concerning their relationship. Penny was worried that she was not smart enough for Leonard, and lied about graduating from community college because she thought it would make Leonard respect her. The relationship quickly deteriorated and she goes back to dating different guys. Leonard showed Penny some literature on Pasadena City College and she interpreted it as him wanting a woman with more education and they break up. She gives relationship advice to Sheldon and Leonard fairly often: Leonard, when he has problems with Priya or Stephanie, and Sheldon when he's with Amy. She also starts to become geekier through the guys. She makes inadvertent references to Star Trek, and, thanks to Sheldon, becomes addicted to Age of Conan. She also dates Stuart, who runs the comic book store. However, when Penny and Stuart are making out, she accidentally calls him Leonard, and as a result, they stop seeing each other. When she learns that the guys are going on an Arctic expedition, she is visibly upset, buys Leonard a farewell gift, and tells herself, after speaking with him, that she wishes he wasn't going. In season three, when the boys get back from the expedition, Penny kisses Leonard the second she sees him; however, Leonard and Penny's relationship has a rocky start because they have some trouble getting used to being more than friends, but they eventually start a relatively stable relationship. It is possible, though not by any means proven, that Penny is at least mildly dyslexic. This is supported not only by her general lack of successes in any kind of education, but also by two separate instances: one time, it took her a lot of time to read a comic book which Amy and Bernadette read much faster, and another time, when she mentions that she doesn't remember how to spell her husband's last name: I know there's a d in there, but it keeps moving every time a try to right it. However, all this may also be explained by her not being academically intelligent."

    "Amy Farrah Fowler":{
        "summary":"Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, Ph.D., is a neurobiologist. Amy is from Glendale, California. She also has a doctorate degree in neurobiology from Harvard University, inspired by actor Mayim Bialik's own doctorate. She initially was discovered by Raj and Howard as a possible match for Sheldon through an online dating service. By Sheldon's own admission, she is most like him by any standard. Like him, she has previously avoided relationships (whether romantic or otherwise is entirely unclear). She has her own apartment. She also has a five-year plan to become Mrs. Cooper. By the ninth season, Amy wants to take a breather from their relationship and a naïve Sheldon pushes her so she breaks-up with him. Later, the two reconcile and resume their relationship eventually moving in together. In the Season 10 finale, Sheldon asks her to marry him, resulting in them getting engaged in The Proposal Proposal. The wedding was on May 12, 2018.",
        "characterization":"When we first met Amy, she seemed quite emotionless and forward speaking (much like Sheldon). After becoming friends with Penny and Bernadette and before and after becoming Sheldon's girlfriend, we see a new (more fun) side to Amy, where she becomes a far more friendly, loving and caring person. She also begins to appear as a voice of reason for Sheldon and teaches him things such as empathy. Though Amy and Sheldon are very similar, they have some notable differences. She does not, for example, share his love of Star Trek, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, comic books, science-fiction, video games or trains. At first, she does not participate in wearing costumes on a whim like the guys do, though she is excited to wear a couples' costume for Halloween one year and, another time, dresses up as a Star Fleet medical officer the play doctor in order to increase Sheldon's feelings for her. Amy is more willing to socialize with others than Sheldon. While Sheldon generally refuses to accept the need for intimacy, Amy appears to desire the kinds of friendship she was denied as a child. Unlike Sheldon, Amy is very much willing to make friends with people and also makes genuine attempts to get along with other people. She is capable of acknowledging that she is part of a group, as shown in The Zazzy Substitution when she uses the phrase my colleagues and I. She also finds people of the opposite sex attractive, although she is initially unable to understand her physical desire for Penny's ex-boyfriend Zack Johnson until it is examined by Sheldon and her. Unlike Sheldon, Amy is also or considers herself politically correct, and this makes her at times not only annoying but also hypocritical. Additionally, she has less of a problem with physical human contact than Sheldon, as seen in The 21-Second Excitation when she, without hesitation, attempted to engage in harmless experimentation with lesbianism with Penny, in The Love Car Displacement when she offered Penny to share a room with her and in The Cohabitation Formulation when she hugged Penny to comfort her, when Penny got upset over Leonard finding a new girlfriend (Priya). In The Agreement Dissection, she, albeit under the influence of alcohol, kissed Penny on the mouth and later did the same to Sheldon the same night. Amy and Sheldon know how each other thinks because when it comes to the game Counterfactuals, only they know the correct answers whose logic is very obvious to both of them. Other people like Leonard do not see how they obtain their answers. It's also likely that other people who have IQs would not be able to see how they obtain their answers. Amy has a habit of being very narcissistic to the point of being callous; when she was asked to be Bernadette's maid of honor, she consistently behaved like the upcoming wedding would be her special day and that she outshone Bernadette, an opinion she never missed an opportunity to voice. When Howard and Bernadette contemplated delaying the wedding, Amy lamented because it wasn't what she wanted, disregarding that it was not essentially her wedding. What differentiates her narcissism from Sheldon's is that she isn't so self-obsessed that she feels obligated to make other people's lives feel completely insignificant to her own. There are also several occasions, far more than Sheldon, where she recognizes what people are feeling and why. Amy is very blunt and says things that make others feel awkward, though she has developed into a very loyal friend to the girls and a devoted girlfriend to Sheldon. She has low self-esteem, the main reason why she always put up with Sheldon when no one else wants to date her. Until The Opening Night Excitation, she also was a virgin and so was Sheldon. Sheldon was not in a hurry to lose his virginity, but Amy was considering it for a long time before they coupled. She is also allergic to avocados and likes Chaucer, medieval poetry, old French movies and writes Little House on the Prairie fan fiction. In Amy's first appearances, she seemed to be rather serious and not very full of emotion like Sheldon; however, upon becoming Sheldon's girlfriend, her personality transitions to that of a joyful and laid back woman with a sense of fun."

    "Howard Wolowitz":{
        "summary":"Howard Joel Wolowitz, M.Eng., is a Jewish aerospace engineer and ex-astronaut. He is the son of an overbearing mother, Debbie Wolowitz, who cares very little about his scientific accomplishments and still talks to him as if he were a child, and Sam Wolowitz who left him and his mother. As the best friend of Rajesh Koothrappali, Howard often hangs out at Leonard and Sheldon's apartment with him. Though he's the only member of the group lacking a doctoral degree, he defends himself by pointing out that he not only has a master's degree in Engineering from MIT, but also designs important inventions like the space toilet and telescope used at the International Space Station and components for satellites and space probes. Fancying himself a smooth ladies' man, Howard is rather confident in trying to woo girls (unlike the other three), mostly through creepy overtures and sometimes with his knowledge of foreign languages, of which he knows seven (if you count Klingon). During the show, he dates and eventually marries Bernadette, with whom he bonded over their dislike towards their overbearing mothers and has been influenced to tone down his creepy behavior. Much later, the couple have a daughter named Halley Wolowitz and a son named Neil Michael Wolowitz.",
        "characterization":"Cheeky, tenderhearted and supposedly suave, Howard provides outrageous techniques in an attempt to get girls in the first three seasons, none of which are remotely successful. Howard's techniques to approach women are varied, including magic and card tricks, ventriloquism, and techniques from the Mystery Method, such as peacocking and negging. He is consistently depicted as the most sex-crazed of the guys, though he doesn't think his sexual behavior is any different from others. One time, he developed a mathematical formula for the likelihood of him having sex by applying and modifying the Drake equation to include the Wolowitz coefficient, which he defined as neediness times dress size squared. He stated, I'm a horny engineer... I never joke about math or sex. He often fantasizes about several actresses, including Katee Sackhoff, but apparently every woman is his type. Howard describes himself as a romantic, although he usually comes across as overtly sexual and sometimes, in Penny's words, disgusting. Later Howard becomes dedicated to Bernadette, although he still uses pick-up lines. He reveals more of his facets to Bernadette. As part of his delusions regarding himself, he opines that he is a tender-hearted poet and crazy daredevil. He claims to appear confident and worldly, though he admits he is not. Also, in the first three seasons, he often put chasing women ahead of his friends, a fact that often annoyed them. Examples of this were seen such as when he chose to have sex with Leslie Winkle instead of covering his friends during paintball, getting them shredded. Also, he chose to chase a woman instead of help Raj during a kite competition, costing Raj a kite that he had been sent from India. Howard is multilingual, using many tongues to try to impress the ladies, sadly to little avail. Most of the languages were revealed in the pilot; in revealed order, they are English, French, Mandarin, Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Howard also speaks Klingon (and plays Klingon Boggle). As shown in The Wiggly Finger Catalyst, he also knows sign language, and in The Hawking Excitation, he speaks Japanese and Binary-coded ASCII. However, Howard may not be as competent a polyglot as he believes. In The Dumpling Paradox, the owner of Szechuan Palace referred to Howard as ...your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin. As evidence, he addressed Penny in Mandarin (saying 洗个痛快澡! - Have a Good Shower!) spoken in the wrong tones. Another time, he addressed Penny in Russian (saying Ты очень красивая девушка — You are a very beautiful girl), but used bad pronunciation. Sheldon also corrected him in The Hawking Excitation, when Howard made a mistake in binary. On the contrary, he speaks his French without any speaking errors. At a cost of his alleged suaveness, Howard can be obnoxious, flippantly derisive and arrogant to an extreme: before he met Bernadette, he made a constant habit of mocking and belittling Leonard about his relationship with Penny as if it had no chance of progressing, completely ignoring the fact that he himself was not in a relationship for the sake of seeming superior to somebody else. Also, when he makes any an accomplishment that he can lord over other people, he will relentlessly remind people about it - most commonly, he brags about having been to space and being the designer for technology that boarded the International Space Station. This particular factor goes to such an extent that people find his bragging extremely annoying and gratuitous, but he barely seems to notice how incessantly he is talking about it. This mostly stemmed from the belief that going into space would be the greatest accomplishment he will ever achieve, and not being able to discuss it would, in his opinion, downgrade its value to him. In spite of this, Howard seemed to believe that simply being an astronaut who went to space made him an American hero. In addition, after he met Bernadette, he first started treating her like a house-wife and when she stated it felt like it wasn't her house, he answered Of course it's your house. Why else would you be cleaning it all the time? and expects her to cater to him in the same way his mother did. He even shamelessly admitted that he'd hoped that, when he met a girl, she would be more like Megan Fox from Transformers (Who is an extremely attractive, but notoriously objectified person, indicating a slightly male-chauvinistic streak). He also tended to act extremely childishly, being lazy enough that Bernadette even set up a 'chore chart' for every time he helped around the house, but even then he only did the bare minimum of housework and expected Bernadette to do it instead. Where his father Sam Wolowitz is concerned, Howard has an extremely complex attitude and opinion. He is repeatedly shown to be furious and resentful towards his father for abandoning him to live with his mother, which is understandable. When he discovers a letter from his father and learns that Sheldon had prematurely read it, his ultimate reaction is to burn the letter cause he doesn't want to hear anything that his father has to say, but he is even angrier when he becomes the only one who has no idea what was in the letter. When he meets his half-brother by his father's relationship with another woman, Howard experiences shock at the discovery that his father had another, visibly developed family. In spite of this, Howard is extremely shameless in this regard and will deliberately use his father's abandonment of him to extricate sympathy out of other people, which is often perceived as selfish and melodramatic. Once Howard finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it. Sheldon even describes him as the funny one in their group, while Howard has said of himself that he is quirky. He mimics voices such as Raj's Indian accent and his mother's accent, and often spews cultural stereotypes. He uses slang such as fo’shizzle to my nerdizzles, demonstrating his supposed street cred. Howard often has married-couple-like arguments with Raj, usually mocking his words or covering for his obnoxiousness, and is the primary means by which Raj is heard whenever Penny is present. Very sensitive, Howard can be traumatized by a hurtful comment from a woman and there is a glimmer of goodness in him that he allowed Penny to see. In fairness, when this actually happened with Penny, he entirely deserved it because he was making insensitive, borderline misogynistic suggestions towards her and had done so at multiple opportunities in the past, and couldn't even notice that he was being conceited and insulting towards her. Howard's questionable insensitivity has also had violent consequences - when Penny engaged in a ferocious fight with Alicia, Howard screamed with excitement at seeing a girl-fight and immediately restrained Leonard out of terror that he would try to break it up - the fight resulted in Penny receiving several brutal injuries and Howard never had the decency to apologize for his part in her injuries, yet he said something to please her. Howard spends a large amount of time playing MMORPGs like World of Warcraft, where he plays a night elf hunter named Wolowizard with a pet tiger named Buttons, and Age of Conan where he is a Guardian named Sir Howard of Wolowitz. Howard enjoys (and is very decent at) Dance Dance Revolution (DDR). He likes reading comics, similar to his friends, and is a Dungeon Master. He has an entire closet of magic tricks. A model rocket enthusiast, Howard designed the engine himself for a three-stage rocket. His advancements in robotics include the Mobile Omnidirectional Neutralization and Termination Eradicator (MONTE) for the Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational. He also once sent a signal around the world via the Internet just to turn on a lamp. He is asthmatic, allergic to peanuts, almonds and walnuts, prone to canker sores and pink eye, succumbs to seasickness, has an incredibly high genetic risk of heart illness and has transient idiopathic arrhythmia. His small size and thin build are also the source of many jokes for people who know him. Aside from being a huge Neil Diamond fan, along with Amy, Howard is heavily implied to enjoy The Beatles due to his Ringo haircut and them being on his personalized CD disc."

    "Rajesh Koothrappali":{
        "summary":"Dr. Rajesh Ramayan Raj Koothrappali, Ph.D., is an astrophysicist and Howard Wolowitz's best friend. Aside from Penny, he often hangs out at Leonard and Sheldon's apartment, though he had his own apartment (the Raj Mahal) in Pasadena. Originally from New Delhi, Raj has an Indian English accent and, ironically, dislikes Indian food and culture. He frequently portrays himself as having come from humble origins and growing up in poverty in India, only for his friends to remind him that his father is a gynecologist, drives a Bentley, and has a house full of servants. For the first six seasons, his principal characteristic was a case of selective mutism social anxiety disorder, which did not allow him to talk to women outside of his family. This condition could be suppressed through alcohol (or if he thought he was drinking alcohol) or experimental social anxiety medications; however, the former usually ended up changing his personality, making him more obnoxious and overbearing (and at times, bitter and jerkish), while the latter tended to have unpredictable side-effects.",
        "characterization":"Originally from India, Raj is slightly clueless about American culture and idioms, and dislikes Indian food and his home country. Sheldon even disputes his knowledge of Indian customs and Hinduism, and reveals Raj's native language is English (which Raj speaks with a mainly-Indian accent with a hint of British), while he seems to speak fluent Hindi. Raj stated that the reason he puts up with Sheldon is so that he could be reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings, according to his Hindu belief of being rewarded after reincarnation for suffering willingly; to Rajesh Koothrappali, karma is practically Newtonian. He hates Indian music; however, he does appreciate the Indian lullabies his mother sang to him, and the catchiness of Hindi phrases, two mentioned phrases being जो जी करे कर - whatever floats your boat; and Fever 104, बहुत अच्छे संगीत का मौजूदा घर. The phrase means: Fever 104, home of the really good current music.On the rare occasions when he actually gets homesick, he picks up the latest issue of Bombay Badonkadonks and performs Bollywood dancing. He is hypocritically sensitive to others' racist jokes about India, though he is not above making racist remarks about India, or, in his view, Gandhi-ville. Raj also claims he can hold out from noxious gases because he grew up in India. Raj likes to say that he comes from the exotic subcontinent of India and had to overcome poverty and prejudice, to make himself appear interesting and mystical, especially when he is womanizing. More often than not, he likes to be associated with Slumdog Millionaire, except when Howard's mother says it. Much like how Howard rarely follows kosher, Rajesh eats beef and believes that some of the Hindu Code of Manu is crazy. Raj also has an extremely ambiguous attitude and opinion of his own country and upbringing, which primarily depends on the situation he finds himself in and how it would benefit him. He believes that his most flattering quality for women is not an aspect of his own character, but the fact that he has vastly rich parents. As stated before, he enjoys portraying himself as a child of poverty who heroically journeyed to America to reach for the stars, but what puts him at the opposite end of this spectrum is his rich parentage. He portrayed himself as such because it makes him appear heroic. Rajesh also tends to heavily rely on his family's wealth for his own lifestyle, often wielding the family fortunes extravagantly. He enjoys his privileged lifestyle to such an extent that, when he wanted something off his father he offered to cut off the cleaning lady so that he could provide for himself, then muttering to Cinnamon that they were both going to be living like animals. Much like Howard would only consider that either his mother or Bernadette would do housework, or any work around his living space, Raj essentially never pays to survive - his parents pay his insurances and rent and he pays someone to buy food and even walk his dog. This leads to the speculation that, even though Raj is an adult, he acts like a spoiled child. In addition, Raj could be extremely pompous when it suited him: he referred to Priya as his baby sister, and when he discovered Leonard was having an affair with her, he verbally prevented it and voiced that he apparently had authority over their relationship. In this same incident, he used Sheldon's claim that Indian women's relationship could be controlled by the older male relative (Meaning that, in order to adhere to this rule that he would have to be loyal to Indian custom), only to arrogantly brush aside Priya's pointing out that he was currently eating meat not permitted in his culture (He claimed, when faced with this, that he could avoid certain regulations of his culture if he considered it crazy). His protectiveness of his sister, or his view of her in general, is laughable in some respects - when he tells Howard to stay away from Priya and stated that she was way hotter than Howard's girlfriend, the exact second after Howard agreed with him Raj snapped, Dude, that's my sister you're talking about!'; later on, when he learns of Howard's pact with Leonard that prohibits them from interest in Priya, Raj is sated when Howard says that they 'pinky-swore' on the pact, but later on he explosively stated that defiling Priya superseded a pinky-swear. He used to have a psychological condition called selective mutism, a recognized social anxiety disorder which rendered him unable to talk to women (with the exception of family members, who were seemingly unaware of his condition, and deaf women, as seen in The Wiggly Finger Catalyst when he could talk in front of Emily), although he quickly learned that he was able to temporarily overcome this problem by consuming either alcohol-containing foods and medicine or experimental anti-anxiety medication. Unfortunately, the alcohol altered his personality and the medications tended to have side effects, such as involuntary face and hand motions, loss of rationality, or jovially stripping naked in public without cognizance of its inappropriate nature. Raj was also able to speak in the presence of women if they were part of a crowd, if he was unaware of their presence, or if he believed that he has been drinking alcohol (a placebo effect, as seen in The Terminator Decoupling when he was able to talk to Summer Glau while drinking beer, but when Howard pointed out that the beer was non-alcoholic, he could no longer speak to her). When Lucy broke up with him In the season six finale, The Bon Voyage Reaction, he discovered while talking to Penny that he was... well, talking to Penny, even though he had not consumed any alcohol since the previous night, which made him realize that breaking things off with Lucy seemed to allowed him to finally overcome his selective mutism. As of season 7, he no longer requires alcohol in order to speak in front of females though it did temporarily return when he first tried to have sex with his arranged bride Anu. One of Raj's primary personality quirks beside his selective mutism is his tendency to speak or act inappropriately in most situations. One primary example of the latter was when, in The Love Car Displacement, he enters Leonard and Penny's room while they are about to have sex, climbs into bed and goes to sleep, completely unaware of what he interrupted. On another occasion, he openly acknowledged having had crushes on Penny and Bernadette directly in front of them, simultaneously making them uncomfortable and making Amy upset, and fails to recognize Amy's change in mood despite Penny and Bernadette's discreet efforts to indicate it to him. Seen in The Santa Simulation. Raj and his friends also have made suggestions like driving around with a van to pick up children for their proposed comic book shop and enticing them with candy, unknowingly suggesting pedophilia. He complains that he is lonely, which leads to Raj hating himself and needing to be reassured of his value. His personality changed in season 4, he was turning into Sheldon cooper and why nobody wants to live with him. While usually sweet, Rajesh Koothrappali sometimes relishes at his friends' misfortunes, especially if he stands to selfishly benefit from said misfortunes (such as, for example, when he expects Bernadette, whom he had a crush on at the time, to break up with Howard, figuring that he could then take advantage and move in on her). Whenever Raj gets an idea or wants to say something slightly controversial in a conversation, he whispers it in Howard or someone else's ear whenever a woman is around. Howard does refuse to say it out loud because he finds it stupid, offensive, or inappropriate, but he ends up saying it anyway through scoffing at Raj. He also has arguments with Howard often, being akin to those of a married couple. He is noted for using gangsta slang, such as fo' shizzle and repeatedly using the word dude. He enjoys reading DC Comics, as do his friends, but he dislikes Aquaman. Raj often obsesses over almost-insignificant details in fiction, such as how the bathroom work in Atlantis, the possible symbolism of ponytails in Avatar, whether Wolverine's prostate is made of adamantium, what zombies would eat if humanity went extinct, how vampires would shave themselves since they can't see their reflections, etc. He has experienced in video gaming and, like Sheldon and Howard, he idolizes Stephen Hawking. Unlike the other guys, Raj has shown great interest in John Grisham novels and Archie comics, the latter being shared with Zack. Raj also has an interest in a number of books, movies and TV shows which are generally targeted towards the female demographic, such as Twilight, The Good Wife, Grey's Anatomy, Sex and the City, Eat, Pray, Love and Bridget Jones's Diary. He follows his parents wishes and relays on them for money as seen in the episode with his drone. He parents heavily follow their religion which Raj also follows however breaks it whenever he is drunk. Eventually he stopped taking his parent's money and moved into an apartment over his friend Bert's garage."
