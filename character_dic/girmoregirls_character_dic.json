    "Lorelai Gilmore":{
        "summary":"Lorelai Gilmore is a principal character on Gilmore Girls. She is portrayed by Lauren Graham.",
        "characterization":"Lorelai Victoria Gilmore was born to Emily and Richard Gilmore in Hartford, Connecticut. Her life growing up was complicated due to an overbearing, neurotic mother and a workaholic father, who both expected Lorelai to live in their world of wealth and privilege. Lorelai is a highly talkative, free-spirited woman, a child of the eighties and part of the MTV generation. Her parents had her future all planned out and arranged for her to come out to society after her sixteenth birthday, but Lorelai was always rebellious and resentful of her structured, sheltered and silver spoon upbringing. She became pregnant with Christopher Hayden and left home shortly after Rory's birth, to create her own, independent life suited to her personality and wishes. Lorelai's eating habits are famously unhealthy; she is a caffeine addict and subsists mostly on diner food and takeout, which influences her daughter, Rory. She and Rory have regular food-and-movie nights, during which they buy enough junk food for several people and proceed to eat most of it. The only time Lorelai desired fruit and vegetables was when she was pregnant with Rory. Lorelai has an excellent metabolism. She is very childish and cannot grow up. Lorelai is sarcastic and funny like a comedian and she is very loyal to people and nice."

    "Rory Gilmore":{
        "summary":"Rory Gilmore is one of the two protagonists on Gilmore Girls. She is portrayed by Alexis Bledel.",
        "characterization":"Lorelai Rory Leigh Gilmore is the only daughter of Lorelai Gilmore and the first born daughter of Christopher Hayden (notably her parents were 16 years old when Rory was born). She was born on October 8th, 1984 at 4:03 in the morning. Though born in Hartford, Connecticut, Rory was raised in Stars Hollow where her mother originally worked as a maid at the Independence Inn. Rory had limited contact with her grandparents, Richard and Emily Gilmore, when she was growing up, usually only seeing them during the holidays. It wasn't until she began school at Chilton that her grandparents became a regular presence in her life. Her father was rarely around during her childhood years. It is stated that Lorelai had wanted Rory to attend Harvard since she was three years old. At the start of the series, she is a sophomore in high school, and when the series concludes, she is a recent college graduate. Rory is defined by her mother's decision to leave her parents and their wealthy life behind, as Emily, Richard and Lorelai herself, put the expectations of a great future (the one the three of them imagined for Lorelai) on Rory's shoulders. She's always applying herself scholastically and doing well when asked to perform tasks that have instructions (notably she tells Mitchum Huntzberger she's always done what was asked of her, and receives a higher SAT score in maths than in verbal)."

    "Luke Danes":{
        "summary":"Luke Danes is a principal character on Gilmore Girls, portrayed by Scott Patterson.",
        "characterization":"Luke is Stars Hollow's local diner owner. He has lived in Stars Hollow his entire life, and his dad's hardware store (William's Hardware, in the middle of town) became his diner after his dad passed away. While his father was heavily involved in town events, Luke has resisted all of them, including most Town Meetings and the War Re-enactments. Though Luke expresses animosity towards town events, it is evident that he cares for the town and never has huge ambitions to leave.[1] When Richard Gilmore attempts to have Luke open up a whole chain of Luke's Diners, Luke respectfully declines as he has no interest in becoming a business magnate. This small-town feeling that he cherishes directly correlates to his failed relationship with Rachel. Luke attended Stars Hollow High School where he lettered in Track (hurdles), a successful team that went to the State Finals more than once, and won twice. After his father died, Luke moved into the office above the diner and converted it into a small apartment. He lived there alone until his nephew Jess Mariano was sent by his mother to live with Luke. Luke is of a very sarcastic nature, often employing dry wit in his exchanges with everyone, and is known as the town grump with a heart of gold."
