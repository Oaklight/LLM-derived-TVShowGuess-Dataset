    "Rachel Greene":{
        "summary":"Rachel Karen Greene (see section Name) is one of the main characters on Friends (1994–2004). She was played by Jennifer Aniston, who received Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe for her performance.",
        "characterization":"Rachel's personality evolves somewhat over the series. Early on, she is portrayed as a spoiled girl. She can often be self-centered, but is often sweet and tries to be a good friend. Later on in the series, especially after she gives birth, she becomes much less self-absorbed. As a girl used to have people at her beck and call, Rachel admits to Mr. Treeger that she has never taken the trash out. When Treeger yells at her for clogging up the trash chute, which he had unclogged shortly before with a lot of effort, Rachel returns to the apartment in tears and exaggerates the situation. Monica dismisses the exaggerations, saying Rachel always cries. (The One With The Ballroom Dancing) She is determined to start her life over and be independent. She was always there for her friends and was respected by them. She respected Ross' job and that he had to work a lot at the start of their relationship even though Ross never respected hers. She always had spirit and made the best out of her situation (The one with George Stephanopoulos). As teasingly established in The One With The Joke, Rachel has a reputation for being a pushover. For instance, in The One With The Cheap Wedding Dress, when Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe attend a sale in Brooklyn to find Monica's wedding dress, a confrontation takes place. Rachel is found huddled in a rack, terrified, blowing her panic whistle. When told to get up, Rachel insists that Phoebe hold her hand. Conversely, Rachel is shown to be strong-willed at times, especially when it comes to standing up for Emma, as shown in The One Where Rachel Goes Back to Work and The One With Rachel's Other Sister. She is not afraid to stand up for her beliefs. When Rachel moves in with Joey you see a new side of her as she has been allowed more freedom and fun. Despite her reputation of being selfish, she is known to be very caring and kind-hearted as she asked Caitlin, a girl who Ross wanted to ask out but couldn't, for her number and gave it to Ross pretending Caitlin gave it for Ross in The One Where Ross Can't Flirt. Instances of Rachel standing up for herself are far and few. For instance, in The One With The East German Laundry Detergent she is bullied by a horrible woman at the Laundromat but gets to assert herself when Ross encourages her. In The One With Rachel's Sister, she angrily confronts Ross but fails to impress anyone. Exceptionally, however, she gets to strong arm her sister, Jill Greene, in the same episode and Joey in The One With Rachel's Book and The One With Phoebe's Cookies entirely on her own. She also claims to have punched a woman in the face for trying to steal her umbrella though there is only her word for it. (The One With Joey's Dirty Day) Despite the personality evolution, Rachel is used to lying. Most significantly, in The One With Joey's Porsche, she commits slander in a legal court, accusing Ross of being mentally unstable, being an intravenous drug addict and having failed to consummate his marriage. Very often, lies are told to inflict damage. For example, in The One With Ross' New Girlfriend, she deliberately misleads Phoebe in hopes of ruining Julie's haircut out of jealousy. Also in The One At The Beach, Rachel tricked Bonnie into shaving her head. There are also instances of deceit that are more impulsive than deliberate, such as claiming that Monica hurt her ankle in The One Where Phoebe Runs or assuming a fake Indian accent in NYU. In The One With Rachel's Sister, Rachel dismissed Jill's fake crying as a deceitful invention of her own that would not fool its inventor. Rachel is shown to not like to take any responsibility for things, which is seen in The One With The Jellyfish, when she wants Ross to take all the responsibility for everything that went wrong in their relationship, when they were both at fault, but this is also seen in The One With The Videotape, when Rachel blames Ross for coming onto her the night they conceived Emma, when it turns out she is really the one who came onto him, clearly showing she doesn't want to take responsibility for that either. Rachel and Ross have a drunken marriage in Vegas which she later confesses was her idea. Rachel also has a very jealous side of her when it comes to girlfriends of Ross or women he likes, despite not being with him or interested in dating him. This is shown mostly in The One At The Beach, The One With The Jellyfish, The One Where Chandler Can't Cry, and The One With The Cooking Class. This is also shown when guys she likes, mention they have a girlfriend. It's shown in The One Where Monica Sings, that Rachel gets mad at Ross for not telling her a guy she met called and Ross took a message and his phone number but never gave it to her, she then and moves back with Joey. In the season 8 episode, The One With The Cooking Class, in the last trimester of her pregnancy she doesn't want Ross to date other women because with their baby coming she wants him to be 100% at her disposal. Despite these issues, Rachel has matured in the later seasons, especially seasons 8-10. Rachel also displays a witty, snarky and sarcastic side to her personality from season 4 onward, mostly directed towards Ross."

    "Phoebe Buffay":{
        "summary":"Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan (née Buffay) is one of the main characters on the popular sitcom Friends (1994–2004), portrayed by Lisa Kudrow. She is best known for her bohemian lifestyle, silly wit and guitar playing in Central Perk.",
        "characterization":"Phoebe is a sweet-natured but odd guitar player. Having experienced nothing like a normal, complete childhood, Phoebe is often very dim-witted, sometimes smart and is in some regards still a child at heart. She believed Santa Claus existed, until Joey told her otherwise. Phoebe also shocks some people in the story line with her frankness on occasions that it catches them off guard from her usual self. This straightforwardness is a running gag throughout the Friends series. Phoebe becomes noticeably a little more intelligent during the last two seasons. Phoebe is the most promiscuous of the three girls, being the one most often referred to as having casual sex. During the episode The One With Rachel's Phone Number, Rachel attempts to convince Mike to do her a favor by promising that Phoebe will do anything he wants: Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff. Mike is surprised that it could get any dirtier. She also told Rachel that she doesn't always ask the men she sleeps with if they're married. In one episode, it has been suggested that Phoebe has had a threesome. In one episode where Rachel and Phoebe fight over a guy Phoebe says that she hasn't been on a date in very long. Rachel claims then that Phoebe had a date 3 days ago to which Phoebe replies, That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex. Another episode has Phoebe and Mike celebrating their anniversary, Rachel asks her So which anniversary? First date? First kiss? First time sleeping together? to which Phoebe replies Yeah. There are several hints that Phoebe is in fact bisexual. For example, Phoebe kisses Rachel in one episode to experience Rachel's claim to be a fantastic kisser, saying afterwards that she has had better. Phoebe says that if she had to select Monica or Rachel to have a lesbian relationship with, she would select Rachel because she is not as high-maintenance as Monica. An example of this occurs in The One with Ross and Monica's Cousin; after Ross and Monica's gorgeous female cousin, Cassie, is shuffled from Monica's apartment to Ross', and finally to Phoebe's (because Chandler and Ross are uncontrollably attracted to her). Phoebe experiences the same sexual desire for her that the men did. (In voice-over we hear Phoebe's thoughts: Ask her out! She's not YOUR cousin!). Phoebe later claims that Monica has the breasts of a Greek goddess. She also seems to have a sort of fixation for old men. In The One Where Ross Got High, she admits to have had a romantic dream with Ross and Monica's father, Jack Geller, and keeps fantasizing with that for a while. When she pretends to be pregnant as a cover up for Rachel, she claims that the father is James Brolin (The One After 'I Do'). When Rachel asks Phoebe to dinner with her dad she replies Sure, yeah. He's kinda sexy. suggesting her interest in Dr. Greene. (The One With The Stripper). When she and Rachel compete for a guy and then a much older one appears, she exclaims We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!, before actually going to dinner with him (The One With Joey's New Brain). Phoebe often uses her chaotic childhood and traumatic past as sympathy ploys to her friends. References to her mother's death were usually to get her own way. Phoebe does not seem to mind that the other friends know she is only referring to her mother's death to try to get her own way. In one episode Rachel says, Now, wait a minute, you can't use that to get the cute guy's phone and the last blueberry muffin! to which Phoebe replies, Did I use that already today? I'm sorry. However, as the series progressed, the other friends indulge her less frequently. Phoebe believes in reincarnation and refers to multiple gods; however, not all of Phoebe's beliefs seem internally connected. She is very open to the existence of paranormal phenomena and willing to consider the most bizarre pseudo-scientific theories, much to Ross' confusion and despair. She, however, does not believe the theory of evolution or even that of gravity, claiming she feels more pushed down than pulled. At one point, Phoebe is even believed to be possessed by the spirit of an 82 year-old woman who had unfinished business. Phoebe also claims to hear voices in her head, and at one point, even heard what Joey was singing in his head. In The One With All The Thanksgivings Phoebe reveals that she believes she possessed the same look in at least two previous lives, and that Joey does not have any previous life memories because he's brand new. Phoebe frequently uses the alter ego Regina Phalange when she is pretending to be someone else, she even adopts a French version called Régine Filange. The first reference to Regina Phalange is when she is trying to contact Ross in England, and pretends to be a Dr. Regina Phalange diagnosing a disease. The last reference is in the series finale when Phoebe successfully stalls Rachel's plane to Paris by saying there was a problem with the left phalange. Her resistance against large corporations is made manifest in several episodes in which she speaks out against chain stores and the ideal of corporate greed, such as in The One With The Apothecary Table (against Pottery Barn, which she later admits liking). In season 9, most notably in the episode The One With The Fertility Test, she tries to convince Rachel not to redeem a gift-certificate to a massage spa because it puts independent massage therapists such as herself out of business. However, when Rachel clandestinely visits the spa to redeem her gift certificate, it is revealed that Phoebe is employed at the spa as a massage therapist because of the good money, benefits, and 401(k) plan (she even exclaims that she has to pay taxes!). Phoebe is occasionally referred to as a heavy drinker, although she never demonstrates any dependence that would make her an alcoholic. In a season 7 episode, when describing her feelings for a man she's dating, she tells Monica I feel like I've had ten drinks today...and I only had 6. She also drank over twenty drinks at a charity event, first saying that she was helping the kids, and later stating, I think I've helped the kids so much I might vomit. At Monica's 30th birthday party, when Monica gets very drunk, Phoebe decides to get twice as drunk so no one will notice Monica. The morning after Ross and Rachel get married in Las Vegas, Phoebe and the rest of the friends have a breakfast buffet. During the breakfast, she explains a few times that she is drunk, after drinking while having breakfast. Towards the later seasons, Phoebe grows noticeably more shrill and mean-spirited, especially towards Chandler and Ross (being considered the more pathetic members of the group). This shift in her personality partly manifests itself in a surprisingly sharp and sarcastic sense of humor, being much more prone to mocking her friends in the later seasons."

    "Monica Geller":{
        "summary":"Monica E. Geller is one of the main characters on the popular sitcom Friends (1994–2004), played by Courteney Cox. Monica was known as the Mother Hen of the group and her Greenwich Village apartment was one of the group's main gathering places throughout the series.",
        "characterization":"While she is kind, caring and friendly, Monica is perhaps most notorious for her obsessive cleanliness (classifying places by cleanliness, where 'Monica-clean' is even cleaner than 'Health-Department-clean'[14]). She is also known to talk abnormally loudly (such as in The One With The Apothecary Table) and for her bossiness and unnatural organizational skills (such as The One On The Last Night). Phoebe and Rachel also call her high-maintenance.[15] Aside from being a neat-freak, Monica can also be bossy and somewhat competitive, hating to lose in competitions. Although less so than Chandler, Ross, Rachel or even Phoebe, Monica also possesses a snide and sarcastic wit that is more subtle than her friends'. Neat Freak Monica is comically obsessive about the state of her apartment. She loves cleaning, describing a dry-cleaning establishment as her Disneyland. This personality trait becomes progressively exaggerated as the series progresses. Examples of this tendency include: In The One With The Embryos, we learn that she organizes towels into 11 categories, including everyday use, fancy, guest, and fancy guest. Later, boxes can be seen with other categories, kitchen, old, and beach. This leaves 4 of the 11 categories unknown to the audience. According to Rachel, she cleans the toilet 17 times a day (even if someone is using it). She labels everything, from dishes to photographs. She even numbers the mugs in her kitchen so that if one of them goes missing, she will know which one is missing. She tries acting like a kook. She pretends that she doesn't care that she has left her shoes in the living room, only to be rendered unable to sleep because she's left to wonder if she should go out and get them. She becomes anxious when Rachel moves the green ottoman while cleaning the apartment. Chandler says to Rachel, Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out. She has admitted to purchasing car-cleaning supplies because there was a dirty car parked out front of the building. She washed it, and six others.[16] When Monica tries to force Rachel to go to the eye doctor, Rachel knocks over a box of cereal in an attempt to distract Monica. Monica pretends that she isn't bothered by this, only to turn around and whine to Chandler about it before she leaves with Rachel. (Chandler agrees to clean up the mess.)[17] On Rachel's last night in the apartment, she fails to pack when she is supposed to. She defends herself by claiming that packing her belongings is a gift for Monica. Monica is happy to hear this, and she even apologizes for not getting Rachel a gift. She is obsessive to the point that she cleans her cleaning supplies, using a Dustbuster to remove dirt from a vacuum cleaner and wishing there was a smaller vacuum to clean the Dustbuster. When Phoebe says they can't meet because she is cleaning and organizing her apartment before Monica forgets and goes to Phoebe's apartment with her label maker. After her birthday party, Rachel offers to help Monica clean up. Monica replies, Are you kidding? You had your party. Now I'll have mine![18] When she finds out that Phoebe has brought rats to Rachel's birthday party, Monica is rendered shell-shocked and she mutters to herself, So this is what a stroke feels like. When Rachel tells Phoebe about her kiss with Gavin, Monica asks how she didn't see it when it was on her balcony. Phoebe replies, It was after the party. You were probably ironing the wrapping paper. Monica looks offended, but then replies, Oh, yeah, reminiscing happily.[19] Chandler cleans the apartment as a surprise for Monica. Ross sees him doing this and says that Monica will kill Chandler if everything is not back in exactly the same place. Monica returns home after a hard day at work and notices that the apartment is different, even though it appears the same. Monica discovers that none of Chandler's CDs are in the right cases when he states, If I can't find the right case, I just put it in the nearest one. Monica responds nervously, Okay. No need to panic. Deep breaths, everyone. I'll just have to spend some time putting them back in the right cases. In The One With The Stain, Monica comes home to find that the apartment has been cleaned... but not by Chandler. Monica asks, Oh, no. Was I cleaning in my sleep again? Chandler replies, I got a maid. Monica nervously says, I hope that by 'maid', you mean 'mistress.' 'Cause if some other woman was here cleaning, then -- Chandler tells her, Honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control. Monica argues,  'Relinquish' is just a fancy word for 'lose'! When she becomes anxious about the maid, she tells Chandler, Usually when I'm this anxious, I clean! In The One With Rachel's Other Sister, Rachel and her sister, Amy, have a fight. Rachel accidentally breaks a plate from Monica's and Chandler's wedding china, causing Monica to nearly faint. In The One Where Ross Is Fine, Monica and Chandler are given a binder about adoption, which is perfectly neat and organized. Monica whispers to Chandler, I think I just had a tiny orgasm. She also forces Chandler wash his hands before he touches the binder because, It's so pretty and white. When Monica and Chandler discuss having a baby, Monica panics that the baby's stuff will take up so much space that there will be no room for the ribbon drawer, causing her to scream, Where will all the ribbons go?! Chandler suggests they make a baby right now before Monica changes her mind, and Monica says she might have to fake it because she's, a little shook up. One of the reasons why Monica is able to keep such a clean apartment is because she has a secret closet full of junk. She is deeply ashamed of this, calling herself sick. She will not allow Chandler to put anything in the closet because he might mess it up.[20]When Chandler is searching for a job, Monica spends eight hours with [her] label maker, organizing a file system in which she has researched and written about tons of different job fields. Chandler ends up picking the first one and apologizes for all her wasted hard work, to which Monica replies that it was immensely fun and she doesn't mind at all. At one point, Monica is excited about organizing all the photos. She shows Rachel a prototype: a picture of her old dog at her birthday party. Monica says she can find the picture under birthdays, dogs, or dead. When Monica asks Rachel to pass her the box of organized photos and Rachel accidentally spills them, Monica freaks out. While dating Monica, Richard makes the bed as a surprise for his girlfriend. Monica remakes it, explaining that the label should be on the other side and going into detail about the other mistakes. When Ross dates a girl with an unbelievably messy apartment and finally breaks it off with her, Monica shows up at her door with a bucket full of soap suds and a broom. She asks the woman if she can clean her apartment, saying she won't be able to sleep if the woman doesn't let her clean it. When the door is slammed in her face, Monica decides to clean the door frame instead. In The One With The Two Parties, Monica hosts Rachel's birthday party and has everyone write down their most embarrassing memory. She repeatedly reminds everyone to put the covers back on the markers, or they'll dry up."

    "Joey Tribbiani":{
        "summary":"Joseph Francis Joey Tribbiani Jr., was one of the main characters on Friends (1994–2004) and the title character in the spin-off Joey (2004–2006). He is best known for being a ladies' man and a rather silly but adorable personality. He was portrayed by Matt LeBlanc.",
        "characterization":"Joey is generally a good-natured, charming and well-meaning person, but not so bright. He loves food, women, sex, family, friends, jam, and the New York Knicks. Joey is known for his love of food and sex. He particularly loves sandwiches and pizza. In The One With Ross' Wedding, Part 2, it is mentioned that the Joey Special is two pizzas. Also, in The One With The Ride Along, he appears to be saving Ross from a supposed gunshot. But in reality, it is his meatball sandwich that he is trying to protect; it just happens to be near Ross. Joey also doesn't like to share food, even with a date, as shown in The One With The Birth Mother. He has a lot of trouble with understanding negative criticism of his acting. Also, although he is usually simple-minded, there are moments where he seems very smart. He discovers Chandler and Monica slept with each other when he hears Monica lost her eyelash-curler, and immediately remembers Chandler saying that the girl he slept with had lost her eyelash-curler. The character was originally not supposed to be anything like he is portrayed throughout most of the series. His original character description mentions him as macho, smug, loves women and most of all Joey which is how we see him for the first two seasons. It was Matt LeBlanc's idea to make a dim character. Joey's simple-mindedness and lack of common sense are demonstrated when Chandler's traumatizing experience at Joey's childhood tailor finally wake him up to the fact that his tailor has been taking advantage of him and his family for 16 years. It can be argued that he is the most promiscuous of the group. He has sex with a variety of women, and quite often will sleep with a woman and never call her again. This includes Laura the adoption assessor but who he convinces didn't call him! Joey has been known to even take shots at and flirt with his female friends. He has actually kissed all of them, and he even dates Rachel for a time. He also frequently imagines lesbian scenes in his head, such as when Rachel tells Monica that they're going out with two nurses. Joey believes that she means female nurses, and seems pleased with the thought. He is something of an idiot savant in matters of romance, and his popular catchphrase/pickup line is, How you doin'? This is directly alluded to when Chandler says, A hot girl's at stake, and suddenly [Joey is] Rain Man after he quickly comes up with an idea for how Ross could find out which of his students referred to him as the 'hottie of the paleontology department' in the end-of-year evaluation. Joey has made up an anecdote referred to as the Europe story, or the magic story, which after hearing it the listener will immediately want to have sex with the storyteller. When Rachel points out that she heard that a man named Ken Adams came up with the story, he confesses to her that he is, in fact, Ken Adams. There have been moments in the series where Joey acts like a hypocrite. This is mostly displayed in The One With The Birth Mother, where it's revealed that he can't stand it when others take food from his plate, as he even loses his cool when his current date, Sarah, takes some of his fries or when Emma, a baby, wants a grape from him. Yet, various times throughout the series, Joey has eaten his friends' food without asking first. In said episode, he eats Sarah's torte despite her telling him not to after the previous plate incident. Additionally, in The One With Joey's Fridge, he continuously tries to make his friends pay for a new refrigerator when his old one breaks by claiming that they were the ones that broke it. However, he himself has taken a lot of money from his friends with no intention on paying them back, as Phoebe claims that he owes her $800 once he demands money from her so he would finally shut up about the fridge. In contrast to his ladies man personality, he has also a marked childish side. He enjoys playing video games and Foosball, exclusively reads comics (The One With The Halloween Party), and is often seen having fun with whatever is around; like a hockey puck (The One With George Stephanopoulos), a scooter (The One Where They All Turn Thirty), a pile of boxes (The One Where Ross Moves In), bubble wrap (The One With Rachel's Going Away Party) or jumping on the bed (The One With The Jam); among many other examples. He even sleeps with a soft toy penguin named Huggsy and has a Cabbage Patch Kid which he named Alicia May Emory. This childishness often leads to a running gag where he is actually treated like a infant. In The One With Rachel's Other Sister, after Ross says Chandler wouldn't get Emma if Ross and Rachel die, Chandler says none of them would get Joey. After they clear things up, Chandler says they can get him, but warns Ross that he [Joey] eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose. In The One Where Rachel's Sister Baby-Sits, Joey writes a recommendation letter for Chandler and Monica and sends it to an adoption agency, who mistakenly believe it had been written by a child. They guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings, and call Joey in return, asking for his mommy and daddy. In The One Where Monica And Richard Are Friends, Joey puts The Shining and Little Women in the freezer after he is too scared or sad to keep reading them, and Rachel has to comfort him and lie to him about the death of a character he liked. In The One With Princess Consuela, Joey and 8-year old girl Mackenzie try to prevent Chandler and Monica from buying a house, and Joey suggests telling them the house is haunted, to which Mackenzie responds What are you? Eight?. He later calls her asking for an unrelated advice, but she redirects him to her stuffed bear, and Joey effectively keeps talking to the toy. Despite generally being ignorant in most academic fields, he purchases a single encyclopedia in The One With The Cuffs. This ends up making him knowledgeable about any topic that begins with the letter V, specifically vomit, Mount Vesuvius, volcanoes, vivisection, the vas deferens, and the Vietnam War. In addition, despite being the least intelligent of the friends and generally easygoing and pleasant, Joey is more than willing to showcase a mockingly sarcastic sense of humor on occasion, having plenty of good one-liners in the first season and throwing the occasional barb or two in the later ones."

    "Chandler Bing":{
        "summary":"Chandler Muriel Bing is one of the main characters on the popular sitcom Friends. He is portrayed by Matthew Perry. He is notable for his sarcastic and witty sense of humor.",
        "characterization":"Though Chandler never lets up by using sarcasm as a defense, he has a tendency to come off as needy and makes bad first impressions as said by Phoebe with his constant joke-making and brash demeanor. Despite this emotional immaturity, Chandler is the most financially secure of his friends. Chandler is brash, zany and estranged from both of his parents. He suffers from commitment issues, brought on by growing up in a broken home with no idea of what a stable marriage looks like, can be neurotic and extremely defensive with humor as his shield but his sense of humor is generally unsophisticated, to the point during an interview when his boss told him he'd have extra duties on his hand he had to stop himself from laughing. Chandler also associates everything that links to his parents' divorce in a negative light, specifically Thanksgiving where his parents reveal their separation over turkey where his father plans to run away with the pool boy. This also associates with his mistrust of people in adult relationships. Becoming extremely paranoid when his girlfriend, Kathy (who was an actress) shared a sex scene with her co-star prompting a big fight between the two. Ironically it was Chandler's own paranoia that drove Kathy to have an affair with the same person. His commitment issues are not only a running gag in the series but as well with his friends who use it as an excuse to mock him. In The One With The Lesbian Wedding, when asked who of the group will get married last they all pointed at Chandler. This could either be a joke, a ribbing on his commitment-phobia or him being the least desirable of the group. However, he was the first friend to happily settle down as a married man. Even when he was a happily married man, Chandler still retained some of his paranoia when it was revealed that their surrogate mother was having twins, he instantly panicked and suggested keeping only one. However, when he discovered they were a male and a female, he was overjoyed. Chandler is relatively comfortable with complimenting looks of the same gender like Phoebe. However, he is quite humiliated by his effeminate nature and is a profound heterosexual whereas Phoebe has been hinted to be bisexual. It's revealed Joey is who he would go out with. Also, when Phoebe saw her perfect guy at Central Perk after reading tea leaves, Chandler remarks Oh my God, that guy was looking at you and he is so cute in a high-pitched voice. He also began acting extremely effeminately when he was listening to a cassette tape for women to stop him from smoking. Because of this, Chandler is normally dominated by his ballsy and forward spouse, Monica and rarely ever wins in a fight with her, however, Chandler does have bursts of confidence. When Monica wanted to use his nest egg to pay for their big wedding he firmly put his foot down, which greatly impressed Phoebe who normally points Chandler out for his effeminate nature, claiming Money, and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with. Chandler also shares a lot of traits with Mr. Heckles, Monica and Rachel's neighbor. They are both extremely picky with women (planning to break up with one simply because her head was too big), were voted class clown in high school, played the clarinet and Chandler even did his signature pound the ceiling with a broom when Monica and Rachel were making too much noise. Probably because of his entire childhood of being humiliated, Chandler would much prefer to follow through on an insane lie rather than admit to the truth and create an embarrassing situation or an actual confrontation. Lacking the nerve to break up with Janice after he rekindled their romance he tells her he is moving to Yemen and actually does when she only agreed to leave the airport after she saw his plane depart, causing him financial loss. This was further shown when he destroyed his own office when an enraged colleague (who had been calling Chandler 'Toby') got word that Chandler Bing stopped him from moving upward and he didn't want to admit that he mistook his name for Toby and never corrected him on it."

    "Ross Geller":{
        "summary":"Ross Geller, Ph.D. was one of the main characters on Friends (1994–2004). He was portrayed by David Schwimmer. He's best known for his nerdy personality and very awkward sense of humor, much like Screech from Saved By The Bell, or David from Beverly Hills, 90210.",
        "characterization":"While he is intellectually smart and can be polite, caring, thoughtful and kind, Ross is often clumsy, oversensitive and socially awkward - taking the characteristics of the stereotypical loser nerd. He also has a dry, sarcastic and witty sense of humor that is second only to Chandler's. He is the only member of the group of friends with a doctorate and, as such, can be arrogant. In most cases, his arrogance backfires or gets the best of him. His arrogance and self-centered behavior is likely also a result of his upbringing, with his parents often overexaggerating everything about him. In later seasons, due to his two failed marriages and ruined life, he starts developing breathtaking anger management issues and is also shown to easily be irritated, often breaking into angry outbursts over minor things. For example, in The One With Ross' Sandwich, Ross is fired from the museum after yelling at his boss for eating his sandwich. This behavior leads to him taking on a more antagonistic role in most episodes in the later seasons. Ross seems to have a immature need to always be right. This is shown in The One Where Heckles Dies when he finds out that Phoebe doesn't believe in evolution. Shocked by this, he spends the rest of the episode pestering her and trying to get her to believe in evolution. He is angered when Phoebe asks him why he has this need for everyone to always agree with him. He seems to find people irrational if they won't conform to his point-of-view. Ross' immaturity was more emphasized and apparent at the beginning of his and Rachel's romantic relationship in which he began spending (if possible) even more time at Monica's apartment and their relationship reverted back to when they were teenagers, which in the same episode Monica reveals she hated him during their youth. However, this isn't unique to one particular episode and they have at times shown traits of typical sibling relationships even at their adult age throughout the series; for example rash outbursts, competitiveness, and physical confrontations. Perhaps the cause of his immaturity is his parents. As he was the favored and academically gifted child who received the more credit and praise in comparison to Monica, some may say he can't always be blamed for his enlarged ego, although he is an adult and has to take responsibility for his actions. Also, he doesn't respond well when his parents don't give him the acknowledgment they usually do and was clearly distraught over Jack's Porsche being given to Monica as a peace offering for ruining her childhood memories, claiming that he was a medical marvel. Ross is also perfectly comfortable lying to his parents especially if it wouldn't tarnish the extremely high mantle they placed him on his entire life. He framed Chandler for making him smoke marijuana in college and when this was revealed in The One Where Ross Got High, he refused to tell Jack and Judy, despite it being years ago and that he had not done so since. He once considered informing them in a letter simply out of sheer cowardice. Ross, despite being socially awkward, dates many women throughout the series. Due to his unsuccessful marriage to Carol Willick, he started to develop fierce amounts of paranoia and insecurities when it comes to women. Monica states that before Carol left Ross for Susan, he was never paranoid or jealous... even though it was obvious to everyone except him that all his previous girlfriends were cheating on him. Due to this, he does not seem to even trust Rachel to be faithful to him and is often prone to jealousy and is quick to suspect his girlfriends of cheating on him. Most of his dates are disrupted or completely ruined once his paranoia or geekiness get the best of him. These paranoias and insecurities often causes conflict in his relationships; for example, when Rachel began spending a lot of time with a co-worker of hers named Mark Robinson, out of paranoia he came to mistakenly suspect that she was having an affair, when in reality she never considered her relationship with Mark to be romantic. She eventually becomes so fed up with Ross' jealousy that she announces that she wants to take a break from their relationship, which Ross takes as a breakup, but Rachel didn't mean a breakup. When Ross later tries to reconcile with her by phoning her at her apartment, he overhears Mark's voice in the background. In reality Mark had come to comfort her as a friend after calling her and hearing she was upset after her fight with Ross, but once again out of paranoia Ross mistakenly thinks he is there to have sex with her and angrily hangs up. Convinced now that his suspicions about her affair with Mark were right and his relationship with her is over, a depressed Ross gets drunk and the sum of the alcohol, his emotional vulnerability and a promiscuous woman named Chloe results in him choosing to have sex with her. He does not learn he had been mistaken in thinking Rachel had sex with Mark until the following morning when he hears a message Rachel left on his answering machine, telling him she wants to work on the relationship. The pair meet again, only to break up for real when Rachel discovers Ross' indiscretion with Chloe. Ross' jealousy also becomes apparent during his relationship with Emily Waltham, when he fears that she is growing too close to Carol's wife, Susan Bunch. His jealous streak rears its ugly head again when he dates his student, Elizabeth Stevens, and ultimately accompanies her on her spring break vacation to ensure she does not stray. Despite being financially secure, Ross is notoriously cheap. He gets his hair cut at the bargain chain Super Cuts; steals toiletries and other amenities from hotels and refuses to tip anyone. He is often mocked by his friends about his annoying habits of correcting people's grammar and avoiding straightforward dialogue when nervous. He tries to convince his friends to act for the best in difficult situations even though such actions may be difficult to carry out. In season 2, he encourages Joey to audition for Another World after being fired from Days of Our Lives, despite Joey's refusal to present himself for a two-line part of a secondary character. In season 7, he buys Phoebe the bike of her dreams but threatens to take it away from her because of her reluctance to learn how to ride it. When he discovers that Joey has a crush on Rachel, he tells him to tell her about it and go for it instead of hiding it, even though he has problems with the idea of Joey and Rachel. Above all, Ross can be sweet and loving, however he definitely has a lot of flaws to his character. He is often looking out for everyone's best interests and the most mature compared to the rest of the gang, despite his ego, outbursts, and paranoia."
