    "Frasier Crane":{
        "summary":"Dr. Frasier Crane is the protagonist of Frasier. He is portrayed by Kelsey Grammer.",
        "characterization":"Frasier Crane is a pedantic, persnickety, over-scrupulous and sometimes pontifical man. Growing up with a cultured mother and an Average Joe father, Frasier is sophisticated and snooty, yet still somewhat capable of enjoying more stereotypical blue-collar activities. During his time at Cheers, he began acting like one of the boys, not paying attention to his cultural roots to fit in better but nevertheless attempting to bring a degree of class to the bar and his friend group even if he was shot down constantly. After returning to Seattle, he began embracing his more cultured background but developed a more prideful and conceited personality, which could be because of him rekindling his relationship and frequently spending more time with Niles. Despite this pretentious demeanor though, Frasier still retained his heart of gold. Described as a pop psychiatrist, Frasier entered the fields of psychiatry to help people due to having his mother, who was also a psychiatrist as a role model. Frasier has done genuine good, but he can go from being a genuine healer to a shameless self-promoter. As displayed on his talk show, Frasier genuinely wishes to help people. However, the celebrity status that came with his radio show has allowed his ego to expand and almost abandon the original reasons he sought out psychiatry in favour of gaining fame instead. Indeed, Frasier is an applause junkie according to Niles as shown when he came very close to abandoning his radio job so he could instead co-star on a morning talk show (which he initially entered vowing bring a degree of sophistication opposed to the usual media ravel the show is based upon) but was fortunately persuaded not to by Niles just in time. On his radio show, Frasier gives the best advice he can but those who ignore him altogether, rebuff his advice or occasionally offend him, are treated to a response of sharp sarcasm. Due to the nature of his profession, Frasier finds it justifiable when he peers into his friends and families personal problems, even with their unwilling consent as he is ultimately driven for their best interests. However, this tends to always have negative effects for them as well as himself. As explained through the show and his backstory, Frasier is a victim of many unfortunate incidents from being bullied into childhood and finding himself into a multitude of embarrassing and farcical situations into adulthood, however most of these are unwillingly self-inflicted due to his own behaviour and neuroses. Both Niles and Frasier believe that the reason they were picked on was envy but Martin elaborates that the two of them came off as pompous and better than their childhood peers which is apparently the true reason behind the bullying. Many of his coworkers at KACL also concur that he comes off as a pretentious snob towards most of them, being the main reason why he was picked on by the KACL jokers like Bulldog and Carlos & The Chicken due to his serious demeanour. Also, as mentioned by a multitude of characters in Frasier's personal life, he is incapable of being happy. Although he does admit to being contented with his new life in Seattle near the end of Season 1, his perfectionism and belief that things, from a new home, city, girlfriend and even a door behind a spa might possibly be better, even be a slight have also caused him bewilderment and problems in his life. Whilst his intelligence and dedication to psychiatry is commonly a gift, it also makes him impractical on seeing things simply and how they usually are. This and his tendency to overthink situations caused him to believe that finding a skull in his summer house was that the house-owner had murdered his wife whereas the easier solution would be that it was a prop form Niles and his childhood rendition of Macbeth. Frasier's lifestyle revolves around the enjoyment of the opera, symphony, gourmet dining and general luxury. Despite an air of pretentiousness, he manages to be slightly more down to earth than his brother Niles. Though he blended in with the crowd at Cheers and is capable of enjoying mundane things such as his father's favorite beer, Balantine, Frasier utterly loathes most of Martin's possessions that he sees as beneath him, such as Martin's grungy BarcaLounger and dog, Eddie. Despite his cockiness, Frasier also proves himself to have a caring side and is willing to make a great deal of sacrifice for his loved ones, illustrated in the way he tolerates these presences due to his father's emotional attachment to them. He also has a high degree of disdain towards people who have PhDs yet are not official doctors such as a dog psychiatrist, psychic doctor and upon discovering a respected counselor received his doctorate from Vegas, both he and Niles mock him over this realization. He has a tendency to deliver long-drafted speeches, occasionally without even realising he is doing, like when he lectured the incompetent KACL assistant to do his job correctly, finishes with I am this close to giving you a lecture. He speaks eloquently in a sophisticated manner he views as cultured and others view as snooty. Whenever he does give a speech, despite delivering with bravado and genuine emotion, is commonly ignored, especially by his family which tends to take him a comical amount of time before realising he is talking to himself. He requires constant affirmation of his brilliance and popularity, and will go to great lengths to provoke others to provide 'spontaneous' praise. Frasier believes that his mannerisms is a testament to the sophistication of his own upbringing but he usually tends to come off as flamboyant and effeminate. In addition, the newly-rekindled relationship between Niles and Frasier has been misinterpreted as gay and their closeness is sometimes seen as abnormal. They tend to remain unaffected by this (except for an incident when they discovered they were similar to the infamous Collyer brothers). A poetic irony of the show is that, even though he is a psychiatrist, Frasier suffers from a degree of mental illness himself. Being left by Lilith caused severe depression, to the point of feigning suicide in an attempt to win her back. He has obsessive-compulsive disorder-like tendencies, like the way he fussily organizes his apartment to match the diagram he created of exactly how it should look like and measuring most of his memorabilia and items, even if they are a hairline off the way they should be positioned. In one episode, after seeing how empty and unfulfilling his life has become, he develops kleptomania and steals from an elderly woman. Frasier discovered the disturbing way that he harbours an Oedipus complex leftover from childhood but he was blinded to the fact that Mia was strikingly similar to his mother after seeing a video of Hester. As a man of high ethical standards, Frasier has a psychosomatic response whenever he breaches his morals. While Niles gets a bloody nose when he breaches his morals, Frasier gets a queasy stomach. On principle he refuses to do advertisements on his show, unlike most on-air personalities."

    "Daphne Moon":{
        "summary":"Daphne Moon is a principal character on Frasier. She is portrayed by Jane Leeves.",
        "characterization":"As the series begins, Daphne is a recent immigrant from England who is employed by Frasier Crane as a live-in housekeeper and physical therapist for his father, Martin Crane. Her quirky personality and claims of psychic abilities provided comic relief on the show, while her relationship with Frasier's brother Niles Crane was a major dramatic plotline during the run of the series, progressing from Niles' secret infatuation at the beginning of the show to their marriage at the beginning of season ten. Like most characters on Frasier, Daphne has many eccentricities. She often tells rambling stories about her family, cheerfully remembering rather grim or traumatic events, to the considerable discomfort of the Crane family. She is also a firm believer in the supernatural, and is a bit psychic. Daphne's apparent psychic abilities are often treated with ambiguity on the show, and her various 'visions' are sometimes shown to have come true -- often in a somewhat roundabout way, sometimes very accurately. She is a kind, caring person, but also incredibly tough."

    "Niles Crane":{
        "summary":"Niles Crane is a principal character on Frasier. He is portrayed by David Hyde Pierce.",
        "characterization":"Niles is fastidious, snooty and persnickety, and has gourmet tastes. He is also faithful, courteous and incredibly loving which more than makes it up in the eyes of his loved ones. He is, in the earlier seasons during his marriage to Maris. He likes and enjoys classical music, fine wine and French food which he himself cooks, and frequently obsesses about knowing the right people and climbing the social ladder. Niles is also extremely rational. Niles has a 156 IQ, well above the Mensa median (which is typically around the low 130s). Niles has a long list of phobias and medical conditions, many of which are clearly psychosomatic. Most prominently, he is quite mysophobic, given to wiping his hands after human contact and wiping down chairs in public places before sitting on them. He has nose bleeds when he tells a fib, and he faints at the sight of blood. When he gets stressed, he is prone to panic attacks and fits of hyperventilation which have, on more than one occasion, seen him lose consciousness. He also suffers from a long list of allergies, some of which are exceedingly rare. He is seemingly hopeless at sports, barely able to catch objects even after simple throws. However, in some episodes he is shown to be fair at basketball. On one occasion, while attending a basketball game, he is fortuitously invited on court during the game's intermission to try his skill (or luck) at scoring from half court, and much to the astonishment of his brother and father (and himself), Niles makes the impossible throw. The brothers are often seen coming or going to squash matches, though Martin once commented in disbelief, You have to wonder what happens on that squash court. Accompanying Martin on the shooting range one day, Niles discovered that he is an excellent marksman. He is a fair fencer, and has had some lessons in kickboxing, apparently being only two moves away from being quite threatening. On other occasions he has expressed interest in lifting weights and taking karate lessons, but these ventures are typically laughed at by his father and brother and often amount to nothing. He is also a master speller, having come close to winning the national spelling competition as a youth."

    "Roz Doyle":{
        "summary":"Rosalinda Roz Doyle is a principal character on Frasier. She is portrayed by Peri Gilpin.",
        "characterization":"Roz was born in Bloomer, Wisconsin. Her mother Joanna was a longtime politician there and serves as Attorney General. She has one sibling, a sister, Denise, whose supposedly perfect life prompts a great deal of resentment by Roz. Roz's parents are divorced and she maintains relationships with both of them, until her father re-marries a younger woman, which confuses Roz greatly and ultimately ends her relationship with her dad. Her grandmother was an immigrant from Ireland. Frustrated with small-town Wisconsin, Roz moved to Seattle as an adult to pursue a career in radio. Roz is a very attractive woman, with a euphonious voice. She has no shame about her promiscuity, which is the subject of many jokes and snide remarks, especially from Frasier's brother Niles. Roz has a Tweety Bird tattooed on her upper thigh (hinted at in Dark Victory, season 2, and revealed in The Dog That Rocks The Cradle, season 7). During the show's run, Roz is often worried about her appearance as she ages and worries that she will never fall in love and get married. She has several brief flings with co-workers, including Bob Bulldog Briscoe (much to her later chagrin). On one occasion, she sleeps with Frasier, but while they are mutually attracted, they agree their relationship works best as friends. Roz also is lusted after by co-worker Noel Shempsky, although the feeling is not reciprocated by any means.Early in the series, Roz and Frasier have a rather strained relationship. But as the show goes on, they become extremely close, often consoling each other through hard times. Nevertheless, the teasing, sardonic element continues through their friendship. Roz has a constantly antagonistic relationship with Frasier's brother, Niles; she teases him about his effete mannerisms and snobbery, while he teases her about her abundance of partners. Their mutual bickering fades gradually as the series progresses and they become more friendly, although it never completely vanishes. Roz quickly befriends Frasier's father, Martin and is the only regular character to address him as Marty. While Frasier and Niles are interested in high culture, Roz and Martin share a more down-to-earth view of life, and grow close over the series. Roz is often invited to join Martin's poker games, which his own sons are not. Roz is also close to Martin's physical therapist (and later Niles' wife), Daphne Moon, due to the fact that they are the only two women who were constant in the Crane men's lives. They end up becoming best friends, and Daphne invites Roz to be her maid of honor at her wedding to attorney Donny Douglas. She was also invited to be the maid of honor at Daphne's wedding to Niles; however, Daphne elopes with Niles in Reno, Nevada and Roz is not present for their real wedding. Early in the fifth season, Roz discovers that she is pregnant with the child of a young college student with whom she had a brief fling. This occurrence serves as one of the main developing points for Roz's character. By the end of the season, Roz gives birth to her new baby girl, whom she names Alice May Doyle. Late in the series, Roz finally manages to maintain a seemingly stable relationship with Roger, a garbageman. Roger meets Roz's needs and gets along very well with Alice. However, in the ninth season episode Frasier Has Spokane, it is revealed that Roz and Roger parted ways after he explains that there aren't any more fireworks, once again leaving Roz in a vulnerable position. Frasier consoles her, and this eventually leads to them having sex in the following episode. Roz subsequently flees home to Wisconsin as Frasier chases after her in an attempt to remedy the situation. Frasier ends up posing as Roger, whom the Doyle family had been very excited to meet, while being a bit skeptical due to Roz's romantic history. It is here that Roz and Frasier reconcile, and agree to remain friends. In the series finale, Roz is promoted to station manager of KACL after previous manager Kenny Daly (who had held the position since 1998) resigns and decides to become a DJ again."

    "Bob Brisco":{
        "summary":"Bob Bulldog Brisco is a principal character on Frasier. He is portrayed by Dan Butler.",
        "characterization":"Bulldog hosts the Gonzo Sports Show on KACL radio. He is known to be a womanizer, and disliked by Frasier Crane. This is because he is more common and pokes fun at Frasier in his many practical jokes. He is an intense sports fan, making many references over his time on the show. In season six, he practically became a main character. In Shut Out in Seattle, his show was cancelled due to bad ratings. In his later appearances, he works first as a pizza delivery boy and then at KACL's archive vault, where he remains well-liked around the station. There seems to be little or no genuine malice in Bulldog - he truly believes deep down that what he's doing is funny, and others will - eventually - get the joke."

    "Martin Crane":{
        "summary":"Martin Crane is a principal character on Frasier. He is portrayed by John Mahoney.",
        "characterization":"Martin is a brash, no bull, charming retired police officer and the father of Frasier and Niles Crane. Martin started working for the police in 1961.Unlike his sons, Martin Crane is very down-to-earth and unpretentious. His tastes are generally simpler than those of his sons and reflect popular culture to a greater degree - he prefers drinking beer (specifically Ballantine) to wine or spirits, for example, and prefers watching action movies and professional sports to the opera and theater preferred by Frasier and Niles. He is a big supporter of the Mariners, the SuperSonics, and the Seahawks, professional sports teams based in Seattle. In the earlier seasons especially, most of the comedy and drama of the series stems from the culture clashes between the refined sons and the blue-collar father (the sons frequently considering themselves superior in both taste and intellectual matters than their father, Niles once admitted that he often doesn't listen to Martin's advice because he doesn't have any credentials), and the struggles between Frasier and Martin in sharing an apartment. Among one of the disputes between Frasier and Martin is a decades old, well-worn (he mentions in Give Him the Chair that he sat in it when he watched the lunar landing and the 1980 Olympics) recliner that Martin owns; Frasier is appalled by its appearance in his living room. Initially Frasier figures the perfect present for his father is to purchase him an expensive leather recliner that replaces Martin's old one. This greatly upsets Martin when he explains the sentimental value of the chair to Frasier, who feels extreme guilt and proceeds to get the recliner back for his father and returns the new one. In Bla-Z-Boy, the chair was accidentally destroyed when it was set on fire and fell off Frasier's balcony. Martin initially bought a new leather recliner as a gift to Frasier, who had already made great effort to replace it, having a carpenter build an identical model from photos and tracking down the original manufacturers of the upholstery. As a result, Martin has a complex and frequently difficult relationship with both his sons, both of whom take after their mother, and have little interest in the traditionally masculine pursuits that interest Martin, such as sports and outdoor activities, just as Martin himself finds little of interest in their pursuits, such as cooking, collecting antiques and opera. Martin also places little stock in (and is frequently and loudly dismissive of) established psychiatry, something which - as both of his sons are passionate psychiatrists - also undoubtedly contributed to the rift between them. On a few occasions, however, he actually exhibits genuine psychological know-how and intellect, surprising Frasier and Niles (although Martin usually waves off these situations and thinks nothing of it; he can, at times, attribute this to his listening to Frasier's radio show). Martin also frequently clashed with and was vocally dismissive of both of his sons' romantic interests (in particular their wives, Maris, and Lillith), which also added to the bad feeling between the men. A dramatic irony frequently shown in the series is that whilst Frasier and Niles may possess more intellectual knowledge and refinement than Martin, it is in fact Martin who is a wiser and more pragmatic individual. Certainly, Martin possesses greater reserves of common sense and experience than his two sons, and whilst his sons may be trained in psychiatry, it is frequently Martin's advice in any scenario that is more sound. He is usually quick to foresee the catastrophes and crises that Frasier and Niles' various plans and actions will result in, and is capable of advising the best way to avoid this - however, their senses of superiority, stubbornness and neuroses frequently ensure that Frasier and Niles will disregard his advice and blunder into chaos anyway. This can lead to Martin at times taking an almost gleeful delight in the misfortunes and downfalls of his sons, and he is often quick to point out that he told them so. However, Martin is prone to letting his stubbornness get in the way of happiness, that Frasier often helps him solve, such as forcing Martin to acknowledge his feelings for one romantic partner, Sherry Dempsey. Martin is a gruff and taciturn man who finds it difficult to express himself emotionally - in particular to his family and loved ones, with whom he can be quite withdrawn and remote. He often comes across as curmudgeonly and ungrateful to Frasier for taking care of him. Martin finds it easier to say the words I love you to both his dog Eddie and his best friend Duke than he does to either of his sons (although he actually said 'I love ya' to Eddie and Duke, which he says doesn't mean the same thing).[6] He is certainly less comfortable with emotional exchanges than either of his sons, who find it much easier to express themselves in such a fashion. His blunt, open manner can make him seem tactless and insensitive. He is quite stubborn, and is given to holding grudges. He has stated that he believes justice should be the same for everyone when he refused to help Niles take care of a legal problem for Maris; he has, nevertheless used his position as an ex-policeman for preferential treatment on occasion, such as when he flashed his badge to a border guard in order to alleviate his suspicions. For all this, Martin is portrayed as an extremely likeable and caring individual. Although he may find it difficult to express his feelings to his sons, he clearly loves them both, remaining proud of and devoted to them, and bitterly resenting any implication that this might not be the case. When Niles goes to a costume party as Martin and is asked to name his biggest disappointment in life, Niles' response (in character and slightly inebriated) turns this into a speech of his distaste for his and Frasier's pretentiousness, snobbery, and lack of athleticism before finally saying if I had to choose my two biggest disappointments. Martin quickly cuts him off, angered at being portrayed as a drunken jackass, and tells Niles that, while he and Frasier weren't what he was expecting, he's always been proud of them."
