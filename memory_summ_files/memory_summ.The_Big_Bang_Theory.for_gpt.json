        "mega_memory": "I threw the first pitch at Angel Stadium, but instead of a ball, I presented a working prototype of the Mars Rover, since I am a scientist. I also remember Sheldon wanting to leave to go to Disneyland but ended up staying to watch.\nLeonard mentioned a team trying to create a chicken dinosaur through DNA manipulation. Sheldon and Howard discussed Sheldon's interest in the idea despite his fear of dinosaurs and chickens. Later, Raj joined and they confirmed plans for the following night. Sheldon brought up a study about losing close friends when getting into a romantic relationship, which Leonard disputed based on his relationship with Amy. Raj insisted he wouldn't drop his friends if his girlfriend didn't like them, but joked that they would eventually be dead to him if they didn't remain close.\nAmy asked about Stuart, but I didn't wanna talk about it. Bernadette said he's still living with my mom, and I complained about all the HBOs he got from my mother. Then Raj, Sheldon, Leonard, and Penny came over. We introduced ourselves, and Penny talked to Emily, who's a dermatologist. Sheldon made a weird request to Emily, and Amy made a sarcastic comment about it.\nI remember talking with Sheldon and Leonard about how we miss Stuart's comic book store while listening to loud music. We discussed Stuart's financial troubles with the insurance company and how he might not reopen. Leonard suggested we invest to become owners of a comic book store and compete with this place. Sheldon joked about a business plan involving genital warts, but we all laughed and agreed it's not that bad.\nSheldon, Leonard, Raj, and I were brainstorming ways to set our comic book store apart from the competition. Raj suggested we get a van to pick up kids and visit parks and schools. Penny got upset when Raj told Emily they hooked up, which led to an argument. Sheldon made a joke about losing friends, but Raj assured him that he's crazy about him.\nSheldon and I talked about opening our own comic book store, and we both thought it would be fun to interact with customers. Leonard brought up something about Penny's list, but Sheldon made a joke about it. We discussed honesty in relationships and Sheldon mentioned an unfortunate comment he made to Amy about her hair. I agreed with Sheldon about asking a wife or fianc\u00e9e before investing money in a store.\nI remember talking about wanting our own comic book store with Raj, Sheldon, and Leonard. We discussed the idea of having comfy seats and snacks too, but were disappointed that it wasn't going to happen.\nI remember discussing an old idea about converting footsteps into electromagnetic energy to charge cell phones while walking with Raj and Leonard at the cafeteria. Sheldon then chimed in and accused Leonard of not pursuing that idea because of Penny's distractions. We ended up brainstorming ideas and considering going on a science retreat, but Sheldon was hesitant due to horror movies like Cabin in the Woods and The Shining. Eventually, we decided to stay and work at the cafeteria.\nRaj came to the apartment and we talked about innovations while the girls were away. We talked about our old ideas and skipped the ones involving robots for s*x. We discussed making the hover board from Back to the Future and decided to watch the movie while Raj made the popcorn.\nMe, Leonard, Sheldon, and Raj were discussing time travel in Biff's case. There was a debate about tenses and how time travel affects the past, present, and future. We got sidetracked talking about wieners and Pillsbury dough.\nLeonard, Sheldon, Raj and I were brainstorming on how to improve hover boards using Maglev technology or quantum coupling. Sheldon suggested using operant conditioning to keep us from straying off topic. We joked around with punishment ideas and Sheldon mentioned the scold's bridle, which he searched for on Amazon.",

Sheldon suggested using operant conditioning to stay on topic. Raj and I watched Back to the Future and made popcorn."

Sheldon was too busy with a spitball to talk.\nBernadette and I were discussing potential side effects of an erectile dysfunction drug. I mentioned that headaches, dizziness, and nausea could occur, to which she agreed. I made a joke about those same symptoms happening if an elderly man with an erection climbed on top of you.

Amy suggested a pub which Sheldon agreed to after seeing Yorkshire pudding on the menu. Leonard made a joke about their relationship. Sheldon claimed that his and Amy's relationship was the best in the group. Leonard and Penny were at the bottom of the \"relationship rank\". We had a small argument with a joke about wine.\nSo, Leonard and Sheldon were arguing about their relationships and Sheldon brought up the U.S. Constitution. Amy made a funny comment about setting her flag underwear on fire.\nWe were at the pub and Sheldon refused to share his burger with me because I'm allergic to avocado. He kept assigning random numbers to things, even relationships. Amy mentioned the Relationship Closeness Inventory and we ended up taking the test. Leonard insisted on it even though I didn't want to.\nLeonard asked if I was mad at him, but I said no. He then asked if it was about the test or us. I told him I was worried that we're engaged and have nothing in common, and that scares me. Leonard admitted that it scares him too sometimes. He tried to make me feel better by saying we both think he's not funny and we're both scared our marriage will be a disaster.\nI apologized to Amy at the pub for comparing relationships, but Sheldon wanted to take on a challenge by testing Leonard and my relationship. Leonard didn't want to, but I convinced him to take the test.

Amy was happy to hear that.\nI remember being at the Angels Stadium with Raj, Leonard, Sheldon, Amy, and Bernadette.

They were worried about me leaving forever, but I needed to escape and think. Penny convinced Leonard to let me go, and I left with their blessing.\nI, Sheldon, asked a man at the railway station if he was knitting pants, but he didn't let me use his phone. I explained that I was on a journey because of various reasons and my possessions were stolen while I slept. I was wearing no trousers because I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle. I also mentioned my profession as a world-renowned physicist and explained the difference between a boson and a fermion. My legs were cold and nobody helped me. Leonard picked me up from the police station in Arizona after my things were stolen. I asked him to bring my toothbrush, mail, and a good comeback for being called chicken legs. He also considered bringing Amy with him. I went to Kingman Police Station and spoke to Officer Hernandez about my stolen belongings. I suggested using Sherlock Holmes' method of elimination, but Hernandez hadn't tried that. Asked about stolen items at the Kingman police station to Hernandez. Mentioned Sherlock Holmes and Cool Ranch Doritos to Leonard. Amy arrived, asks if I'm okay and why she came. Told her shotgun in a whisper. Leonard asked me about my trip and I told him I went to many cities, but never left the train station. He was confused and asked me why, to which I replied, \"That's where all the cool trains are.\" I also mentioned that I never had a single piece of fruit. I was playing a game with Leonard and Amy in the car. Hunt's ketchup at the Indianapolis train station. Amy got mad at me for not saying goodbye and calling Leonard instead of her. I asked for privacy to talk to Leonard and told him about my plan to have coitus with Amy. I called Leonard because I didn't want Amy to think less of me. Amy said it's okay that I'm not perfect, but then I wanted to break up with her because she hurt my feelings. I recently went on a trip and did not feel better after coming back. Leonard and Amy tried to convince me that it was still an accomplishment, and that the trip was good for me. I compared myself to Gandalf the Grey and ultimately feel renewed and ready to face any changes. When I saw Penny back, I noticed that she had changed her hair and couldn't handle it, so I left. I showed my trip photos to Penny and Leonard, and shared my experience of traveling across the country without ever leaving the train station. I almost died in a fire in Des Moines but managed to survive. Also, my photos were backed up in the Cloud after my phone got stolen.\nAs Sheldon, I had a conversation with Howard, Raj, Amy, Leonard, Penny, and Bernadette about the possibility of creating interspecies supersoldiers. We discussed using gorillas, hippos, owls, and koalas, but ultimately settled on cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. The conversation then shifted to Penny's new job in pharmaceutical sales, and there was some perceived awkwardness between her and Bernadette about reviewing the materials. Leonard made a quip about being a teacher's pet, which reminded us of a time when Ms. McDonald forgot a quiz.\nI had an awful meeting with human resources. They made me a junior professor and required me to teach a class. Leonard thinks the kids will love me because I enjoy telling people they're wrong and giving grades. Howard thinks I love the sound of my own voice. Raj asked why it's bad that I have to teach.\nLeonard, Howard, and Raj came to check on my class, but no one signed up because apparently I have a reputation for being obnoxious. Howard wanted to take my class, but I refused since it's a graduate-level physics class, and I don't think he'd understand a single thing I was talking about.\n\"Amy interrupted me while I was trying to prepare my lesson plan, and started talking about her conversation with Bernadette and Penny. I told her to stop and focus. She then jokingly threatened me about dating the popular girl.\"\nI was up late working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz. Leonard questioned why I try so hard to prove that I'm smarter than him. He thinks it's because I'm scared of someone being smarter than me. I asked him how I can use Howard's peanut allergy against him.\nHoward expressed concern that I may be trying to belittle him by making our class unnecessarily hard. I assured him that we both can benefit from this experience and we proceeded with the class. However, Howard's behavior became disruptive, starting with his singing and culminating in shooting a spitball at me.\nI was at Amy's lab and overheard a conversation between Amy and Penny, where Amy invited Penny to Color Me Mine but Penny declined to study for work. Then Bernadette showed up and said she couldn't come to Color Me Mine because she had promised to help Penny study. I briefly spoke to Amy before leaving.\nLeonard assured me that my uvula is not infected, but it doesn't feel innocent anymore. Howard violated the sanctity of my mouth and I reported him to human resources. Howard dropped my class, but I knew he wasn't smart enough for it anyway. He challenged me on engineering, but I proved him wrong. Thankfully, I remembered Poiseuille's law.\nI asked a question about Easter while playing a trivia game with Leonard, Raj, and Howard. We answered questions about galactic years and Archimedean solids. Then Howard asked a question for a Cadbury Creme Egg, and we all answered correctly. We celebrated our success but also pondered why we weren't popular in high school.",

They were having a nice dinner as an engaged couple and Penny mentioned wanting to pick a date that worked with her brother's schedule.\nI talked to Sheldon over the phone, he's doing well. Leonard and Penny think it's for the best that he's taking a sabbatical, but I don't understand how they could let him go.\nLeonard thanked me for coming with him on a six-hour drive, and I assured him that I wasn't upset that my boyfriend called him instead of me. We both acknowledged that time would pass quickly. I went to the Kingman Police Station to see Sheldon, my boyfriend. He seemed alright, but mentioned something about using Cool Ranch Doritos instead of cocaine. Leonard was there too. When I asked him why I came, he said he had something to tell me but whispered it instead; he said \"shotgun.\" Sheldon and Leonard were discussing ketchup brands at different train stations. Sheldon then brought up calling Leonard for help and not saying goodbye to Amy. Amy was upset about this and asked for privacy to talk to Sheldon. Sheldon then told Leonard about wanting to have coitus with Amy and called himself a failure for not being able to do something on his own. Amy reassured him that it's okay and that he doesn't need to be perfect. Sheldon then said he wants to break up with her. Sheldon is feeling down about his trip but Leonard reminds him that he accomplished something. Amy chimes in and says that the mishaps make it an adventure. Sheldon compares himself to Gandalf and claims to have returned stronger.

Later, I ended up telling Penny about my hookup with Emily, which she didn't appreciate. Sheldon made a joke about losing friends, and I ended up telling him that he's not the next one to lose.\nI remember visiting Penny's apartment where Emily apologized for being rude in the past, and Penny and I cleared up our old issues. We all sat down and talked it out, complimenting each other's beauty, and I ended up jokingly mentioning my struggles in my love life.\nI just had a good conversation with Penny and Emily at Penny's apartment. Emily suggested that we should all have dinner one night with Leonard, which Penny and I agreed to. As we were saying goodnight, Emily and Penny said in unison, \"I hate her.\"\nWe were talking about our plans to have our own comic book store, but unfortunately it did not work out. Sheldon pointed out that it would have been great to have a peaceful place to read comics. Howard added that he wished we had comfy seats and snacks. We all sighed in disappointment.\nRaj suggests having a science retreat to the gang since they have lost their focus on ideas, but Sheldon is hesitant to go to certain places because of horror movies, such as Cabin in the Woods and Jaws.\nHey, so we were at the apartment and the guys were talking about their inventions. Howard made a joke about my girlfriend being in a pit and we discussed the Facebook movie. Then we looked at old ideas and talked about robot girlfriends and prostitutes. Sheldon mentioned how science fiction has inspired real-life inventions and we decided to focus on creating something from Back to the Future II. We talked about the hoverboard and how it's possible at absolute zero, then decided to watch the movie and I offered to make popcorn.\nSo, we were trying to make sense of the time-travel plot in Back to the Future and Sheldon started questioning the grammar in our conversation. Howard and Leonard tried to clarify things, while I pointed out how weird the name \"Biff\" is. Overall, we didn't really get anywhere and ended up getting sidetracked.\nLeonard suggests using Maglev technology for hover boards. Howard proposes supercooling materials with quantum coupling. Sheldon suggests operant conditioning techniques to stay on topic, and brings up teaching pigeons to play ping-pong with behavior modification. They talk about punishments for straying off topic, including using a rubber band or the scold's bridle. Sheldon looks up the latter on Amazon.\nLeonard suggests arm hair yanking as punishment for getting off topic. Sheldon questions who decides if it's off topic. Howard votes tangent or not. Negative reinforcement is corrected to positive punishment. Bill Murray makes a mistake in Ghostbusters with negative reinforcement. Procrastination in the lab leads to suggestions of watching Ghostbusters. Sheldon insists on watching the whole movie but Leonard disagrees.\nI remember discussing dark matter with Sheldon, Leonard, and Howard. We talked about the government-funded experiment and the possibility of working in the mines. Bernadette joked about them riding in a mine cart while Penny teased them about it. Amy also made a comment about Penny's shirt.",

Sheldon initially didn't want to go to a pub, but I suggested it and it passed as a proposal. Sheldon likes the pub because they serve Yorkshire pudding, even though he doesn't like it. He thinks he and I have a superior relationship compared to the others in our circle, which upset Leonard and Penny. They started arguing, and I made a joke about Penny talking to her drink instead of them.\nLeonard and Sheldon are arguing about their relationships being wonderful. Sheldon seems to think that their relationship is better because they enjoy spending time together while Leonard believes that they too enjoy it. Leonard taunts Sheldon about how he considers himself the best at everything. Meanwhile, Penny doesn't seem to care while Amy tries to calm things down. Sheldon defends the idea of having a contract-based relationship, and everyone ends up having a mini conversation around it. Amy adds a witty comment in the end, and the conversation finishes.\nAt the pub, Penny and Sheldon argue over sharing food while Leonard mocks their relationship. Sheldon rates everything and compares it to a Relationship Closeness Inventory, but Penny thinks it's stupid. I got a score of 8.2 out of 10 with Sheldon according to the inventory.\nI had a conversation with Sheldon, Penny, and Leonard at the pub. They were comparing relationships, but Penny and I apologized for it. Sheldon suggested taking on Koothrappali and his dog for a challenge, and Leonard defended their relationship. Sheldon suggested a test to determine their compatibility, but they were hesitant. Leonard expressed that he wants to do scary things with Penny and an eight-point-two score was achieved.\nSo, we were at Angels Stadium to watch Howard throw the first pitch, and Sheldon was not interested in the game. Amy offered to buy him cotton candy and a bobblehead to stay. Howard ended up pitching with a Mars Rover prototype, and it didn't go as planned. Sheldon wanted to leave and go to Disneyland, but we ended up waiting for the pitch to end.\nI asked Howard about Stuart and his living arrangements, but he didn't want to talk about it. Bernadette mentioned that Stuart will be living with Howard's mom. Howard complained that Stuart got more HBOs than he did growing up. Later, Raj introduced Emily, a dermatology resident, to everyone. Sheldon awkwardly joked about his buttock freckles, and Penny offered to practice her sales pitch on Emily.

Sheldon was too busy with a spitball to talk.\nBernadette and I were discussing potential side effects of an erectile dysfunction drug. I mentioned that headaches, dizziness, and nausea could occur, to which she agreed. I made a joke about those same symptoms happening if an elderly man with an erection climbed on top of you. Bernadette offered to stop but I was okay to continue. We decided to go for a drink and call Amy to join us. Amy greeted us when we called her.\nHoward was practicing throwing a ball for a baseball game. Raj heckled him and Sheldon made fun of him for not being picked for a team.

Raj continued to heckle Howard and they eventually stopped playing.\nSheldon talked about his lecture and the Cornish game hen dish. Amy made a sarcastic comment about their unhappy waiter. Sheldon and Amy planned a movie night and invited Penny for a double date, but Sheldon didn't care if she came or not.\nSheldon and Amy wanted to have a picnic in a park, but Sheldon shot down the proposal. Amy suggested a pub which Sheldon agreed to after seeing Yorkshire pudding on the menu. Leonard made a joke about their relationship. Sheldon claimed that his and Amy's relationship was the best in the group. Leonard and Penny were at the bottom of the \"relationship rank\". We had a small argument with a joke about wine.\nSo, Leonard and Sheldon were arguing about their relationships and Sheldon brought up the U.S. Constitution. Amy made a funny comment about setting her flag underwear on fire.\nWe were at the pub and Sheldon refused to share his burger with me because I'm allergic to avocado. He kept assigning random numbers to things, even relationships. Amy mentioned the Relationship Closeness Inventory and we ended up taking the test. Leonard insisted on it even though I didn't want to.\nLeonard asked if I was mad at him, but I said no. He then asked if it was about the test or us. I told him I was worried that we're engaged and have nothing in common, and that scares me. Leonard admitted that it scares him too sometimes. He tried to make me feel better by saying we both think he's not funny and we're both scared our marriage will be a disaster.\nI apologized to Amy at the pub for comparing relationships, but Sheldon wanted to take on a challenge by testing Leonard and my relationship. Leonard didn't want to, but I convinced him to take the test. We got an eight-point-two, but Leonard assured me that our score doesn't matter and that he just wants to hold my hand and face the scary idea of marriage together. Amy was happy to hear that.\nI remember being at the Angels Stadium with Raj, Leonard, Sheldon, Amy, and Bernadette. Howard was throwing the first pitch, but instead of a ball, he introduced his Mars Rover prototype. The pitch was slow, and the crowd tried to make it go faster by booing.

They were talking about Stuart, who lives with Howard's mom and has seven HBOs. I found out that Emily is a dermatologist and Penny is training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep.

Stuart asked what the catch was.\nI remember riding in Howard's car and joking about his mom's relationship with Stuart. He was worried they were getting too chummy and I teased him about being replaced as her son. I visited Howard\u2019s mom's house with Howard, and Stuart surprised us by still living there with his girlfriend Debbie. While we were talking, Mrs. Wolowitz called for Stuart to help her find her glasses. Howard and Raj criticized Stuart for not informing Howard about his living arrangement earlier. Howard and I were talking about a guy in his thirties who's living with his mother. Howard found it weird and asked if I thought it was odd, to which I said that it wasn't necessarily weird because they're both adults and might just need each other's company. We joked around and left a message on their answering machine.\nI remember a conversation among us about creating supersoldiers by impregnating women with gorillas, and we discussed other animals as well like hippos, koalas, and owls. Then we talked about Penny's new job and Bernadette asked her to look over some materials, which made things a bit awkward before we moved on to discussing teacher's pets.\nRaj discussed couple's nicknames with Howard and Leonard while Sheldon complained about having to teach a class and joked about failing his students.\nSheldon's class was cancelled because no one signed up. He blames it on his obnoxious reputation. He brought cookies and was going to play a trick. Howard tries to join but Sheldon doesn't think he can handle the material. They argue about which field is smarter.\nI remember Sheldon worrying about his uvula having an STD which Leonard assures him isn't true. Howard and Sheldon have a heated argument about a class Howard dropped and the sanctity of Sheldon's mouth. They try to quiz each other about topics they are not familiar with. Howard asks Sheldon about quantifying the strength of materials and preventing eddy currents in a transformer.

I challenged him on why he feels the need to prove he's smarter than Wolowitz. I suggested he may have emotional issues related to his need to feel intellectually superior. Sheldon then asked me how he can use Howard's peanut allergy against him.\nSheldon was worried about his uvula having an STD, but I assured him it didn't. Howard and Sheldon had a dispute over a class, and Howard challenged Sheldon's knowledge of engineering. Raj asked some questions, and Sheldon answered with confidence.\nI asked a question about a galactic year and Raj answered correctly, earning cheers from all of us. Then Howard asked a question about an Archimedean solid, and we all answered together. Raj wondered why girls didn't like us in high school, and we concluded that it was because we were awkward and couldn't play sports.\nHoward tries practicing baseball to prepare to throw out the first pitch for the Angels, but struggles at first. Raj heckles him while Sheldon reminds him of his lack of athleticism. Penny congratulates Howard on his opportunity and also pokes fun at Sheldon's Quidditch team. Overall, it's a playful scene among friends.\nSheldon boasted about his lecture to Amy who disliked it. Sheldon defended his dissatisfaction with the Cornish game hen served at a restaurant, later shared with Leonard and Penny. Sheldon and Amy planned to see a movie on a date, which led to Penny and Leonard's surprise. Sheldon tried to make up for missed dates and invited them on a double date. However, after realizing it wouldn't count as two dates, he didn't care if they joined or not.\nSheldon and Amy proposed a picnic in the park, but Sheldon added too many amendments and Amy suggested going to a pub instead. Sheldon initially opposed but changed his mind after finding out they serve Yorkshire pudding. Sheldon and Amy have a superior relationship to the rest of us. There is no official ranking, but if there was, we wouldn't be at the bottom. Penny and I bicker about what she drinks.\nThis conversation was about Sheldon comparing his relationship with Amy to mine with someone else. He claimed they have a strong relationship because they enjoy spending time together, even if they're doing different things. We argued about it, with Penny wondering why we care so much. Sheldon defended his views, referring to the U.S. Constitution as a basis for a relationship agreement. Amy eventually jokes about a fire starting in her flag underwear.\nI was at the pub with Amy, Penny, and Sheldon. Sheldon was being Sheldon, quantifying everything. He refused to share his food with Amy because it had avocado. Penny didn't want to take the Relationship Closeness Inventory, but Sheldon and Amy got an 8.2 out of 10. Penny left to get another drink.",
        "summ_memory": "Leonard recalls various conversations and events with Sheldon and their friends, including Sheldon's train trip, his job as a professor, and his relationship with Amy. They discuss topics ranging from creating supersoldiers to baseball, and often bicker and joke with each other. Pennys' and Leonard's relationship is also shown to be strained at times. Throughout the memories, Sheldon's eccentricities and quirks are on full display, but there is a sense of camaraderie and affection among the group."

Raj was going to let Stuart stay the night but has to cancel with Emily. Stuart also complained about everyone sounding like insurance companies, police, firemen or therapists.\nI helped Stu take care of Mrs Wolowitz and we're leaving now. Stu loves her and even calls her Debbie. Something feels weird about it but I'm not sure why.\nRaj thanked me for the ride, joking about the car windows. I teased him back, but then we realized I wasn't taking him to work. I explained my mom's situation with Stuart, and Raj made a joke. Inside, Stuart and my mom were together, which surprised me. I confronted Stuart about not telling me, and we argued. Raj mentioned communication, we left. In the car, we discussed Stuart living with my mom, debated, made a joke, and I called my mom.

I jokingly suggested we get married, but Leonard was insecure about being a \"bran muffin\" and not an exciting choice. I told him I just wanted him and we got engaged, but it felt a bit anticlimactic until he gave me a ring covered in monkey hair.\nI remember announcing to everyone that Leonard and I were engaged, and everyone cheering and congratulating us. Raj made a joke about sleeping with Emily being the big news, and Bernadette mentioned how Leonard proposed all the time but this never happened. Howard updated us on his mom's situation and how they lost another nurse.\nMy mom called and I had to reassure her that Leonard is still the same guy. Bernadette came over and warned me that marrying him means marrying his family. Amy asked about our living arrangements and since I'm not working, Bernadette offered me a job in home health care, which I reluctantly accepted.\nMrs. Wolowitz's house - Bernadette said she could've ridden a bull longer than that, but I told her to keep her money.\nLeonard cooked for me and we talked about setting a date for our wedding. Amy came and told us Sheldon was missing because he was angry we suggested he moves out. We had dinner as a newly engaged couple.\nLeonard is worried about Sheldon and wants to track his phone because he hasn't heard from him in a while. Sheldon is at the train station and Leonard wants to go get him. It's sweet how Leonard looks out for Sheldon, and it's not just because of their friendship.\nLeonard tracked Sheldon's phone at the train station. Sheldon wanted to leave and go off on his own, but Leonard and I tried to convince him to come home. Eventually, we agreed to let him go and wished him luck.\nAmy said Sheldon is doing okay and they will talk to each other tomorrow. Leonard and Penny agreed that it's for the best that Sheldon took a sabbatical. Amy asked Leonard why he let Sheldon go.\nLeonard and I were in his apartment, he declined my offer to do yoga with me, and then he received a call from Sheldon who got robbed in Kingman, Arizona. Leonard agreed to go pick him up and bring his stuff. I couldn't go with him because of a job interview. Leonard asked me if he should invite Amy to come with him. I went to Howard and Bernadette's apartment and talked to Bernadette about my nervousness for a pharmaceutical sales job interview. She boosted my confidence and convinced me to go. Bernadette suggested it was similar to being a waitress and the main role would be selling their antidepressants. I felt unprepared but Bernadette reminded me she wouldn't have recommended me if she didn't think I could handle it. Dan asked me why I thought I'd be a good pharmaceutical sales rep. I told him I'm a people person and my previous job as a waitress prepared me for sales. Dan mentioned having an insulin pump and I said \"people\" way too many times. I went to a pharmaceutical company office for an interview, but I didn't do well. Dan asked me how to convince physicians to switch to their drug. I made a joke about washing cars in a bikini and apologized for wasting his time. I asked him not to tell Bernadette about my bad interview because I'm scared of her. Surprisingly, Dan was scared of Bernadette too and said that she's a bully. He shared an experience where he had to tell her that they were cutting the funding for a drug she was developing but he couldn't do it. We both decided not to tell Bernadette about our conversation. So, Sheldon comes back from a trip feeling down, but Amy and Leonard encourage him that he accomplished something. Sheldon compares himself to Gandalf the Grey and feels renewed after his experience. When Penny enters with a new hairstyle, Sheldon can't handle the change and leaves abruptly. So, Sheldon showed us pictures from his trip where he travelled the country by train and never left any station. He even took Imodium to avoid using the train bathroom, but it didn't last long after Des Moines. Leonard made a pun about silver linings when Sheldon's phone got stolen, but luckily, his photos were backed up to the Cloud.",

Dan, the interviewer, and I decided not to tell Bernadette, who recommended me for the job, about our conversation."

We playfully teased each other until Howard mentioned checking on his mom. Stuart had moved out now that her cast was off, which made things awkward. We joked about it, but Howard seemed unsure. Suddenly, Stuart showed up at Mrs. Wolowitz's place and revealed he and Debbie decided to stay together. Mrs. Wolowitz called for Stuart, surprising Howard. I encouraged him to call his mom more often, agreeing that it's weird for someone in their thirties to live with their mother. Howard questioned me about his mom, and to his surprise, I gave him my blessing. Mrs. Wolowitz and Stuart pranked us, and before we parted, I reminded Howard to leave a message.\nI remember a conversation among us about creating supersoldiers by impregnating women with gorillas, and we discussed other animals as well like hippos, koalas, and owls. Then we talked about Penny's new job and Bernadette asked her to look over some materials, which made things a bit awkward before we moved on to discussing teacher's pets.\nRaj discussed couple's nicknames with Howard and Leonard while Sheldon complained about having to teach a class and joked about failing his students.\nSheldon's class was cancelled because no one signed up. He blames it on his obnoxious reputation. He brought cookies and was going to play a trick. Howard tries to join but Sheldon doesn't think he can handle the material.

Leonard asks Howard to give Sheldon a hard question, but Howard thinks the previous ones were tough enough. Sheldon manages to answer Howard's last question though.\nLeonard asked a question and I answered correctly. We all cheered. Howard asked another question and we all answered together.

Penny and I announced our engagement, which took everyone by surprise. But hey, it was a happy moment and we had a great time celebrating.\nI was at the cafeteria with Raj, Howard, and Sheldon. Raj was feeling hungry, and we joked about the possible reasons. Sheldon was upset about being forced to continue with string theory, and Howard suggested a job in home care. Raj had his own way of dealing with low moods.\nI told my mom about my engagement, but she already knew thanks to Sheldon. She didn't seem too enthusiastic about it, but said if Penny is good enough for Sheldon, then she's good enough for her. I expressed my frustration with how much my mom talks to Sheldon instead of me. She also said I should work on wanting her approval.\nI talked to Sheldon about our living arrangements now that Penny and I are engaged. He offered to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period, but we were thinking more of us living together without him. He didn't understand why we would suggest such a thing, and I told him it's because I love Penny and want to give her the life she deserves.\nI cooked for Penny and we discussed setting a date, but it depends on her brother's schedule. Amy came over looking for Sheldon and we talked about his need for alone time. Penny kicked Amy out after she asked about the food.\nI was worried about Sheldon and asked Penny if she thinks he's okay. I tracked his phone and found out he was at the train station alone at night, which I didn't like. Penny and I decided to go get him. It's not just about looking out for him, but also avoiding the wrath of my mother.\nI tracked Sheldon's phone to the train station where he wanted to leave forever, but Penny and I convinced him to come home. However, Penny thinks it may be good for him to go on his trip.

Amy questioned why Sheldon was let go.\nSheldon got robbed and called me to pick him up from a police station in Arizona. He needs me to bring pants, toothbrush, and mail. Penny couldn't come with me because of her job interview. She didn't object to me inviting Amy along. I remember thanking someone for coming to my car and offering to accompany me on a long journey. We discussed their boyfriend being in trouble and how they were not angry that he called me instead of them. The person said it was their pleasure to join me, and we agreed that time would fly by. I remember being at the Kingman Police Station with Sheldon and Hernandez. Sheldon mentions Sherlock Holmes and Cool Ranch Doritos, which prompts me to say his name. Then, Amy enters and asks if he's okay. Sheldon seems surprised and asks why she came. When she asks if he has anything else to say, he whispers \"shotgun.\" Leonard asks Sheldon about his travels and is surprised to learn that Sheldon never left any of the train stations he visited and didn't have any fruit. Sheldon and I were in the car talking about ketchup at different train stations. Amy was with us but was upset that Sheldon didn't say goodbye before leaving town and called me for help instead of her. Sheldon wanted privacy to talk to me about wanting to have sex with Amy and why he called me instead of her. Amy was frustrated and stopped listening. Sheldon eventually admits to calling me because he didn't want Amy to think less of him and was worried about breaking up with her. I was with Sheldon and Amy in the stairwell, discussing Sheldon's recent train trip. Amy tried to point out the positive aspects, while Sheldon likened himself to Gandalf the Grey. When Penny arrived, Sheldon got overwhelmed and left. Sheldon showed us his travel pictures, which were backed up to the Cloud. Leonard made a joke about silver linings. Sheldon had travelled the entire country but never got off the train, and even almost died in a fire.\nDuring a conversation, Sheldon brought up the topic of Joseph Stalin's attempt to create supersoldiers by impregnating women with gorillas. The rest of us discussed what other animals would be suitable for this purpose. Later, when Bernadette asked Penny about her new job in pharmaceutical sales, Sheldon sensed some tension, and we joked about being teacher's pets in school.\nI remember discussing Sheldon's new junior professor job, and how he's not too thrilled about teaching.

Sheldon got robbed and Leonard went to pick him up in Arizona. Leonard asked me to go with him, but I couldn't because of a job interview. I talked to Bernadette about it and she reassured me. I went for the interview and had an awkward conversation with Dan. Then, I had a weird conversation with Sheldon about string theory. I tried to lighten the mood with jokes, but he didn't get them and even corrected my grammar. At least I got a good laugh out of it. Sheldon always entertains me with his quirks.\nWe were all discussing the idea of creating super soldiers by impregnating women with animals. Sheldon suggested koalas would be the best choice, while Leonard thought hippos would make badass soldiers. Then, the conversation shifted to my new job in pharmaceutical sales, and Bernadette wanted me to start on the material before starting next week. There was some awkwardness, and Sheldon sensed it. Finally, Leonard brought up being a teacher's pet.\nAmy was in the lab stimulating the pleasure cells of a starfish. We were supposed to go to lunch, but she needed to turn off the stimulation before leaving. Bernadette wasn't coming with us because she's been bugging me since she helped me get my job. Amy mentioned that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends, and asked \"what is that little skank's problem?\" about Bernadette.",

We quizzed each other on technicalities; I gave him a hard time, but he managed to keep up.\nLeonard, Raj, Sheldon, and I were hanging out at the apartment, playing a trivia game. We answered some tough questions and felt pretty smart. We also joked about why girls didn't like us in high school. Good times.\nI was practicing throwing a baseball because I'm going to throw out the first pitch at an Angels game as an astronaut. Raj was heckling me and Sheldon joined in, reminding me of my lack of athletic ability. Penny came out and congratulated me, calling me the athlete of the group. Sheldon bragged about his Quidditch team and Penny made a joke about it. Eventually, I threw the ball while Raj continued to heckle me.\nRaj asked if I ever played baseball as a kid, but I threw my arm out the day of tryouts because of my dad's Playboy collection. Bernadette tested our distance from home plate to the pitcher mound, and I couldn't believe it when we finally reached the sixty feet mark.",

Howard and Sheldon had a dispute over a class, and Howard challenged Sheldon's knowledge of engineering. Raj asked some questions, and Sheldon answered with confidence.\nI asked a question about a galactic year and Raj answered correctly, earning cheers from all of us. Then Howard asked a question about an Archimedean solid, and we all answered together.

Sheldon defended his dissatisfaction with the Cornish game hen served at a restaurant, later shared with Leonard and Penny.

However, after realizing it wouldn't count as two dates, he didn't care if they joined or not.\nSheldon and Amy proposed a picnic in the park, but Sheldon added too many amendments and Amy suggested going to a pub instead. Sheldon initially opposed but changed his mind after finding out they serve Yorkshire pudding. Sheldon and Amy have a superior relationship to the rest of us. There is no official ranking, but if there was, we wouldn't be at the bottom. Penny and I bicker about what she drinks.\nThis conversation was about Sheldon comparing his relationship with Amy to mine with someone else. He claimed they have a strong relationship because they enjoy spending time together, even if they're doing different things. We argued about it, with Penny wondering why we care so much. Sheldon defended his views, referring to the U.S. Constitution as a basis for a relationship agreement. Amy eventually jokes about a fire starting in her flag underwear.\nI was at the pub with Amy, Penny, and Sheldon. Sheldon was being Sheldon, quantifying everything. He refused to share his food with Amy because it had avocado. Penny didn't want to take the Relationship Closeness Inventory, but Sheldon and Amy got an 8.2 out of 10. Penny left to get another drink.\nLeonard asked Penny if she was mad at him at the pub. She said no but expressed her worry that they are engaged and have nothing in common. Leonard admitted that he is also scared about that. They both agreed that they are afraid their marriage will be a disaster. They also both think that Leonard is not funny.\nWe were at the pub and Penny and Amy apologized for comparing relationships. Sheldon suggested we take a test to see if we were a good couple. I didn't want to, but Penny insisted. I said I didn't care about our score, I just wanted to marry her. Amy was happy with what I said and Sheldon claimed we got an eight-point-two.\nI remember being at Angels Stadium with Raj, Penny, Sheldon, Amy, and Bernadette. Howard threw the first pitch, but instead of a regular pitch, he used a Mars Rover prototype that was going too slow, causing the crowd to boo.

Howard mentioned having comfy seats and snacks. In the end, we all sighed.\nI remember discussing our past venture of converting footsteps into electromagnetic energy to charge a cell phone. Sheldon mentioned that it was because we got distracted by the girls in our lives, and asked each of us about our greatest accomplishments since meeting them. Raj, Howard, and I all had silly answers. We talked about potentially having a science retreat and where to go, but Sheldon shot down all the ideas with movie references.\nPenny suggested going to Vegas with the girls, leaving me and the guys to have a science retreat.\nRaj, Howard, Sheldon and I were brainstorming inventions while the girls were out.

We ended up deciding to watch Back to the Future II instead.\nWe were discussing the time-travel logic behind Biff stealing the sports almanac in 'Back to the Future Part II'.

Amy asked if anyone has ever said they hated me to my face, but didn't actually say it.\nI remember that we were discussing ways to get more kids into the comic book store, and someone suggested using a van to pick them up. Then Raj mentioned something about telling everyone we hooked up, which I didn't appreciate, and Sheldon made a joke about losing friends.\nAmy and Bernadette were trying to cheer me up about a girl who doesn't like me.

We all joked around and reminisced about how Amy and I didn't used to be friends.\nLeonard asked if it's okay to invest in Stuart\u2019s comic book store because it's a big deal financially and we're engaged. I asked if he considers credit card debt a big deal financially.\nRaj and Emily visited my apartment, where Emily apologized for being rude. Raj expressed his desire for all of us to get along, but I assured them that what happened between Raj and me was in the past. Emily and I complimented each other's looks, and Raj clumsily joked about his single life.\nHad a great night with Raj and Emily, we're planning to have a dinner with Leonard. Before leaving, we said goodnight and then Emily and I said, \"I hate her\" simultaneously.\nLeonard asked if they could have a science retreat this weekend instead of brunch on Sunday. I suggested going to Vegas instead and everyone agreed to check flights and hotels. Leonard seemed okay with the plan. Amy got really excited and said something about peeing. Bernadette and I are planning a girls' weekend in Vegas.\nAmy suggested going to a cover band in the lounge, but I wasn't interested until she said they played Barry Manilow and were called Fairly Manilow. We then joked about getting margaritas and dancing until we vomited, but my boss called and moved up my field ride, so I had to study instead. Amy and Bernadette decided not to go see Fairly Manilow without me.\nI remember the three of us in the hotel room, Bernadette admitting to being the one who pooped at a party, and then offering to go to a club to see Australian male strippers. I had to decline because I still needed to study, and they offered to help me study so I can finish quicker.\nAt the Vegas strip club, Bernadette and I were cheering while the music was blaring. We admired a dancer's body, and Amy made a funny remark about corpses in her anatomy class.\nPenny suggests going to the pool but both groan. She reminds them that nerds and losers stay in the room.

I was working on writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate.\nAmy made me Strawberry Quik with syrup instead of powder, which I didn't like. Leonard might not want to live with me anymore now that he's engaged to Penny. Amy suggested that I live with her, but I declined.\nStuart's comic book store caught fire, and he doesn't know when he'll be able to reopen. I offered to help him and bought a wet comic book. Stuart made a sarcastic comment about only having hundreds, which I didn't appreciate. Also, a light fell where Stuart was standing.\nLeonard tracked my phone to find me at the train station. They were worried about me leaving forever, but I needed to escape and think. Penny convinced Leonard to let me go, and I left with their blessing.\nI, Sheldon, asked a man at the railway station if he was knitting pants, but he didn't let me use his phone. I explained that I was on a journey because of various reasons and my possessions were stolen while I slept. I was wearing no trousers because I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle. I also mentioned my profession as a world-renowned physicist and explained the difference between a boson and a fermion. My legs were cold and nobody helped me. Leonard picked me up from the police station in Arizona after my things were stolen. I asked him to bring my toothbrush, mail, and a good comeback for being called chicken legs. He also considered bringing Amy with him. I went to Kingman Police Station and spoke to Officer Hernandez about my stolen belongings. I suggested using Sherlock Holmes' method of elimination, but Hernandez hadn't tried that. Asked about stolen items at the Kingman police station to Hernandez. Mentioned Sherlock Holmes and Cool Ranch Doritos to Leonard. Amy arrived, asks if I'm okay and why she came. Told her shotgun in a whisper. Leonard asked me about my trip and I told him I went to many cities, but never left the train station. He was confused and asked me why, to which I replied, \"That's where all the cool trains are.\" I also mentioned that I never had a single piece of fruit. I was playing a game with Leonard and Amy in the car. Hunt's ketchup at the Indianapolis train station. Amy got mad at me for not saying goodbye and calling Leonard instead of her. I asked for privacy to talk to Leonard and told him about my plan to have coitus with Amy. I called Leonard because I didn't want Amy to think less of me. Amy said it's okay that I'm not perfect, but then I wanted to break up with her because she hurt my feelings. I recently went on a trip and did not feel better after coming back. Leonard and Amy tried to convince me that it was still an accomplishment, and that the trip was good for me. I compared myself to Gandalf the Grey and ultimately feel renewed and ready to face any changes. When I saw Penny back, I noticed that she had changed her hair and couldn't handle it, so I left. I showed my trip photos to Penny and Leonard, and shared my experience of traveling across the country without ever leaving the train station. I almost died in a fire in Des Moines but managed to survive. Also, my photos were backed up in the Cloud after my phone got stolen.\nAs Sheldon, I had a conversation with Howard, Raj, Amy, Leonard, Penny, and Bernadette about the possibility of creating interspecies supersoldiers. We discussed using gorillas, hippos, owls, and koalas, but ultimately settled on cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. The conversation then shifted to Penny's new job in pharmaceutical sales, and there was some perceived awkwardness between her and Bernadette about reviewing the materials. Leonard made a quip about being a teacher's pet, which reminded us of a time when Ms. McDonald forgot a quiz.\nI had an awful meeting with human resources. They made me a junior professor and required me to teach a class. Leonard thinks the kids will love me because I enjoy telling people they're wrong and giving grades. Howard thinks I love the sound of my own voice. Raj asked why it's bad that I have to teach.\nLeonard, Howard, and Raj came to check on my class, but no one signed up because apparently I have a reputation for being obnoxious. Howard wanted to take my class, but I refused since it's a graduate-level physics class, and I don't think he'd understand a single thing I was talking about.\n\"Amy interrupted me while I was trying to prepare my lesson plan, and started talking about her conversation with Bernadette and Penny. I told her to stop and focus. She then jokingly threatened me about dating the popular girl.\"\nI was up late working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz. Leonard questioned why I try so hard to prove that I'm smarter than him. He thinks it's because I'm scared of someone being smarter than me. I asked him how I can use Howard's peanut allergy against him.\nHoward expressed concern that I may be trying to belittle him by making our class unnecessarily hard. I assured him that we both can benefit from this experience and we proceeded with the class. However, Howard's behavior became disruptive, starting with his singing and culminating in shooting a spitball at me.",

Amy came over looking for Sheldon and we talked about his need for alone time. Penny kicked Amy out after she asked about the food.\nI was worried about Sheldon and asked Penny if she thinks he's okay.

Sheldon showed us pictures from his trip, despite losing his phone.

When I finally expressed my disappointment, he shattered my heart by wanting to break up. In the stairwell, I tried supporting him, reminding him of his accomplishments. But when Penny showed up with a new hairstyle, Sheldon couldn't handle the change and abruptly left.\nSo, we were having a conversation about supersoldiers and which animal would be best for the program. Then, we moved on to Penny starting her new job in pharmaceutical sales and Bernadette giving her some advice. Sheldon sensed some awkwardness, but Leonard made a joke about being a teacher's pet.\nI was stimulating the pleasure cells of a starfish before going to lunch with Penny. We talked about Bernadette and how she's been bugging Penny since helping her get the job. I mentioned that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between friends.\nI told Sheldon about a funny situation with Penny and Bernadette after drinks. He wasn't interested and wanted to focus on a lesson plan, but I reminded him that we were finally the popular ones in high school. However, he shut me down because he was busy trying to intellectually emasculate Howard.\nI called Penny to suggest going to Color Me Mine and sneaking in some Pinot, but she declined to study with Bernadette. Later, Bernadette and I talked about their earlier disagreement, and Sheldon was too busy to talk.\nPenny and Bernadette discussed the side effects of an erectile dysfunction drug. Penny made a joke about the side effects of sleeping with an older man. They decided to go out for a drink and invited me, Amy, to join.\nSheldon asked if I enjoyed his lecture and I replied, \"No, and neither did our waiter.\" We talked about Cornish game hen and then planned a movie night which turned into a double date with Sheldon inviting Penny.\nSheldon, Leonard, Penny, and I had a conversation about going out. Sheldon initially didn't want to go to a pub, but I suggested it and it passed as a proposal. Sheldon likes the pub because they serve Yorkshire pudding, even though he doesn't like it. He thinks he and I have a superior relationship compared to the others in our circle, which upset Leonard and Penny. They started arguing, and I made a joke about Penny talking to her drink instead of them.\nLeonard and Sheldon are arguing about their relationships being wonderful. Sheldon seems to think that their relationship is better because they enjoy spending time together while Leonard believes that they too enjoy it. Leonard taunts Sheldon about how he considers himself the best at everything. Meanwhile, Penny doesn't seem to care while Amy tries to calm things down. Sheldon defends the idea of having a contract-based relationship, and everyone ends up having a mini conversation around it. Amy adds a witty comment in the end, and the conversation finishes.",
        "summ_memory": "In the memory, Sheldon's sabbatical announcement frustrated me, and his strange behavior at the police station confused me. My anger grew when he continued a nerdy game in the car, and he then broke my heart by wanting to break up. We had various conversations about friends, work, and relationships, with some arguing and joking. Ultimately, I made a witty comment to end the conversation. In the midst of it all, I found solace in a beautiful garden, feeling peaceful and connected to nature."

We playfully teased each other until Howard mentioned checking on his mom. Stuart had moved out now that her cast was off, which made things awkward. We joked about it, but Howard seemed unsure. Suddenly, Stuart showed up at Mrs. Wolowitz's place and revealed he and Debbie decided to stay together. Mrs. Wolowitz called for Stuart, surprising Howard. I encouraged him to call his mom more often, agreeing that it's weird for someone in their thirties to live with their mother. Howard questioned me about his mom, and to his surprise, I gave him my blessing. Mrs. Wolowitz and Stuart pranked us, and before we parted, I reminded Howard to leave a message.\nI remember a conversation among us about creating supersoldiers by impregnating women with gorillas, and we discussed other animals as well like hippos, koalas, and owls. Then we talked about Penny's new job and Bernadette asked her to look over some materials, which made things a bit awkward before we moved on to discussing teacher's pets.\nRaj discussed couple's nicknames with Howard and Leonard while Sheldon complained about having to teach a class and joked about failing his students.\nSheldon's class was cancelled because no one signed up. He blames it on his obnoxious reputation. He brought cookies and was going to play a trick. Howard tries to join but Sheldon doesn't think he can handle the material. They argue about which field is smarter.\nI remember Sheldon worrying about his uvula having an STD which Leonard assures him isn't true. Howard and Sheldon have a heated argument about a class Howard dropped and the sanctity of Sheldon's mouth. They try to quiz each other about topics they are not familiar with. Howard asks Sheldon about quantifying the strength of materials and preventing eddy currents in a transformer. Leonard asks Howard to give Sheldon a hard question, but Howard thinks the previous ones were tough enough. Sheldon manages to answer Howard's last question though.\nLeonard asked a question and I answered correctly. We all cheered. Howard asked another question and we all answered together. Leonard thinks we're smart. Then, we talked about why we didn't have girlfriends in high school.\nI heckled Howard while they were playing baseball, and Sheldon joined in. Penny came and found out Howard was practicing to throw the first pitch for the Angels. Sheldon mentioned he plays Quidditch. Leonard was encouraging Howard to throw.\nRaj asked Howard if he played baseball as a kid but he didn't because he found his dad's Playboy collection on the day of tryouts. Then Bernadette measured a distance of sixty feet, six inches for the pitcher's mound in Major League Baseball, and Howard was surprised that it was that far.\nAt the gym, Howard struggled to learn how to throw a ball, Bernadette wasn't much help, and Raj encouraged him to keep trying.",
        "summ_memory": "In my recent memory, I had a fun time with friends, joking and discussing various topics. We were unexpectedly pranked by Mrs. Wolowitz and Stuart, and talked about creating supersoldiers and Penny's new job. Sheldon complained about teaching and we argued about intelligence while playing a quiz game. I encouraged Howard to call his mom more often and supported him during his baseball practice at the gym. It was a lively and enjoyable gathering that I will always treasure."

He then asked if it was about the test or us. I told him I was worried that we're engaged and have nothing in common, and that scares me. Leonard admitted that it scares him too sometimes. He tried to make me feel better by saying we both think he's not funny and we're both scared our marriage will be a disaster.\nI apologized to Amy at the pub for comparing relationships, but Sheldon wanted to take on a challenge by testing Leonard and my relationship. Leonard didn't want to, but I convinced him to take the test. We got an eight-point-two, but Leonard assured me that our score doesn't matter and that he just wants to hold my hand and face the scary idea of marriage together. Amy was happy to hear that.\nI remember being at the Angels Stadium with Raj, Leonard, Sheldon, Amy, and Bernadette. Howard was throwing the first pitch, but instead of a ball, he introduced his Mars Rover prototype. The pitch was slow, and the crowd tried to make it go faster by booing. Sheldon suggested going to Disneyland while waiting for the pitch to end.\nI met Howard, Bernadette, Raj, Sheldon and Emily at their apartment. They were talking about Stuart, who lives with Howard's mom and has seven HBOs. I found out that Emily is a dermatologist and Penny is training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep.

        "mega_memory": "Leonard tracked my phone to find me at the train station. They were worried about me leaving forever, but I needed to escape and think. Penny convinced Leonard to let me go, and I left with their blessing.\nI, Sheldon, asked a man at the railway station if he was knitting pants, but he didn't let me use his phone. I explained that I was on a journey because of various reasons and my possessions were stolen while I slept. I was wearing no trousers because I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle. I also mentioned my profession as a world-renowned physicist and explained the difference between a boson and a fermion. My legs were cold and nobody helped me. Leonard picked me up from the police station in Arizona after my things were stolen. I asked him to bring my toothbrush, mail, and a good comeback for being called chicken legs. He also considered bringing Amy with him. I went to Kingman Police Station and spoke to Officer Hernandez about my stolen belongings. I suggested using Sherlock Holmes' method of elimination, but Hernandez hadn't tried that. Asked about stolen items at the Kingman police station to Hernandez. Mentioned Sherlock Holmes and Cool Ranch Doritos to Leonard. Amy arrived, asks if I'm okay and why she came. Told her shotgun in a whisper. Leonard asked me about my trip and I told him I went to many cities, but never left the train station. He was confused and asked me why, to which I replied, \"That's where all the cool trains are.\" I also mentioned that I never had a single piece of fruit. I was playing a game with Leonard and Amy in the car. Hunt's ketchup at the Indianapolis train station. Amy got mad at me for not saying goodbye and calling Leonard instead of her. I asked for privacy to talk to Leonard and told him about my plan to have coitus with Amy. I called Leonard because I didn't want Amy to think less of me. Amy said it's okay that I'm not perfect, but then I wanted to break up with her because she hurt my feelings. I recently went on a trip and did not feel better after coming back. Leonard and Amy tried to convince me that it was still an accomplishment, and that the trip was good for me. I compared myself to Gandalf the Grey and ultimately feel renewed and ready to face any changes. When I saw Penny back, I noticed that she had changed her hair and couldn't handle it, so I left. I showed my trip photos to Penny and Leonard, and shared my experience of traveling across the country without ever leaving the train station. I almost died in a fire in Des Moines but managed to survive. Also, my photos were backed up in the Cloud after my phone got stolen.\nAs Sheldon, I had a conversation with Howard, Raj, Amy, Leonard, Penny, and Bernadette about the possibility of creating interspecies supersoldiers. We discussed using gorillas, hippos, owls, and koalas, but ultimately settled on cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. The conversation then shifted to Penny's new job in pharmaceutical sales, and there was some perceived awkwardness between her and Bernadette about reviewing the materials. Leonard made a quip about being a teacher's pet, which reminded us of a time when Ms. McDonald forgot a quiz.\nI had an awful meeting with human resources. They made me a junior professor and required me to teach a class. Leonard thinks the kids will love me because I enjoy telling people they're wrong and giving grades. Howard thinks I love the sound of my own voice. Raj asked why it's bad that I have to teach.\nLeonard, Howard, and Raj came to check on my class, but no one signed up because apparently I have a reputation for being obnoxious. Howard wanted to take my class, but I refused since it's a graduate-level physics class, and I don't think he'd understand a single thing I was talking about.\n\"Amy interrupted me while I was trying to prepare my lesson plan, and started talking about her conversation with Bernadette and Penny. I told her to stop and focus. She then jokingly threatened me about dating the popular girl.\"\nI was up late working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz. Leonard questioned why I try so hard to prove that I'm smarter than him. He thinks it's because I'm scared of someone being smarter than me. I asked him how I can use Howard's peanut allergy against him.\nHoward expressed concern that I may be trying to belittle him by making our class unnecessarily hard. I assured him that we both can benefit from this experience and we proceeded with the class. However, Howard's behavior became disruptive, starting with his singing and culminating in shooting a spitball at me.\nI was at Amy's lab and overheard a conversation between Amy and Penny, where Amy invited Penny to Color Me Mine but Penny declined to study for work. Then Bernadette showed up and said she couldn't come to Color Me Mine because she had promised to help Penny study. I briefly spoke to Amy before leaving.\nLeonard assured me that my uvula is not infected, but it doesn't feel innocent anymore. Howard violated the sanctity of my mouth and I reported him to human resources. Howard dropped my class, but I knew he wasn't smart enough for it anyway. He challenged me on engineering, but I proved him wrong. Thankfully, I remembered Poiseuille's law.\nI asked a question about Easter while playing a trivia game with Leonard, Raj, and Howard. We answered questions about galactic years and Archimedean solids. Then Howard asked a question for a Cadbury Creme Egg, and we all answered correctly. We celebrated our success but also pondered why we weren't popular in high school.\nHoward practiced throwing a baseball for a pitch with Leonard and Raj heckling him while Penny joined in. Sheldon reminded everyone that he was part of a Quidditch team and also insulted Howard's baseball abilities.\nI had dinner with Amy and had Cornish game hen, our waiter wasn't familiar with the history of Cornwall. I'm making up for missed date nights by inviting Penny on a double date, but it seems a double date doesn't count as two dates, so I don't really care if she comes or not.\nAt Penny's apartment, we discussed committee meeting proposals which ultimately led to us choosing to go to a pub due to the availability of Yorkshire pudding. Despite criticisms, Amy and I continue to have the superior relationship in our circle. A dispute arose between Leonard and Penny regarding her preferred wine.",

Bernadette mentioned that Stuart will be living with Howard's mom. Howard complained that Stuart got more HBOs than he did growing up. Later, Raj introduced Emily, a dermatology resident, to everyone. Sheldon awkwardly joked about his buttock freckles, and Penny offered to practice her sales pitch on Emily. I couldn't help but feel annoyed at how quickly Howard's mom was accommodating Stuart's living situation, even though Howard didn't have it as good growing up.\nI remember discussing Emily with Penny and Bernadette in Penny's apartment. Penny felt like Emily didn't like her, but Bernadette reassured her. Penny also mentioned a past experience with a teacher who had a crush on her. I asked if anyone had ever told Penny they hated her to her face, but didn't say it myself because of Penny's nice cheekbones.\nI remember Penny talking about her feud with Emily, and how she didn't understand why Emily was so upset.

Sheldon suggests a questionable plan, but Leonard says it's not that bad.\nSheldon, Leonard, Howard, and I were discussing ways to boost our comic book store's sales. We came up with the idea of using a van to pick up kids from different places. Later, I ended up telling Penny about my hookup with Emily, which she didn't appreciate.

He offered to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period, but we were thinking more of us living together without him. He didn't understand why we would suggest such a thing, and I told him it's because I love Penny and want to give her the life she deserves.\nI cooked for Penny and we discussed setting a date, but it depends on her brother's schedule. Amy came over looking for Sheldon and we talked about his need for alone time. Penny kicked Amy out after she asked about the food.\nI was worried about Sheldon and asked Penny if she thinks he's okay. I tracked his phone and found out he was at the train station alone at night, which I didn't like. Penny and I decided to go get him. It's not just about looking out for him, but also avoiding the wrath of my mother.\nI tracked Sheldon's phone to the train station where he wanted to leave forever, but Penny and I convinced him to come home. However, Penny thinks it may be good for him to go on his trip. Ultimately, we let Sheldon go and wished him luck.\nAmy updated Sheldon's condition and we agreed that the sabbatical worked in his favor. Penny thinks this will be for the best. Amy questioned why Sheldon was let go.\nI walked into the apartment and Penny asked about yoga. I declined, needing coffee first. Sheldon called from a police station and needed help. I asked Penny to come, but she had a job interview. I invited Amy and she joined me in the car. Sheldon and I arrived at the police station. Sheldon made a strange comment about Sherlock Holmes and Cool Ranch Doritos. Amy asked why he didn't show more gratitude. Sheldon whispered \"Shotgun.\" Sheldon then listed cities he never visited, content with just being at the train station. We had a heated discussion about condiments. Sheldon confessed his fear of disappointing Amy and suggested breaking up. He expressed regret in the stairwell. Sheldon couldn't handle Penny's new hairstyle and abruptly left. Sheldon showed us pictures from his trip, despite losing his phone. Sheldon shared a harrowing experience in Des Moines.\nDuring a conversation, Sheldon brought up the topic of Joseph Stalin's attempt to create supersoldiers by impregnating women with gorillas. The rest of us discussed what other animals would be suitable for this purpose. Later, when Bernadette asked Penny about her new job in pharmaceutical sales, Sheldon sensed some tension, and we joked about being teacher's pets in school.\nI remember discussing Sheldon's new junior professor job, and how he's not too thrilled about teaching. Raj suggested couple's nicknames for him and Emily, while Howard questioned the reasoning behind the names.\nLeonard and Howard were trying to see how Sheldon's class was going, but it turns out no one signed up. Sheldon brought Fig Newtons and planned to use it in a trick question about who the cookie was named after. Howard wants to take Sheldon's graduate-level physics class but Sheldon doesn't believe Howard is smart enough.\nI had a conversation with Sheldon about his lesson plan for Wolowitz. I challenged him on why he feels the need to prove he's smarter than Wolowitz. I suggested he may have emotional issues related to his need to feel intellectually superior. Sheldon then asked me how he can use Howard's peanut allergy against him.",

We convince Sheldon to come home, but he ends up at a police station while Penny has a job interview. In the midst of various conversations, I have a discussion with Sheldon about his need to feel intellectually superior. It's a memory filled with emotions and the ups and downs of our relationships, but ultimately, it reminds me of the importance of supporting and understanding each other."

Amy made a funny comment about setting her flag underwear on fire.\nWe were at the pub and Sheldon refused to share his burger with me because I'm allergic to avocado. He kept assigning random numbers to things, even relationships. Amy mentioned the Relationship Closeness Inventory and we ended up taking the test. Leonard insisted on it even though I didn't want to.\nLeonard asked if I was mad at him, but I said no. He then asked if it was about the test or us. I told him I was worried that we're engaged and have nothing in common, and that scares me. Leonard admitted that it scares him too sometimes. He tried to make me feel better by saying we both think he's not funny and we're both scared our marriage will be a disaster.\nI apologized to Amy at the pub for comparing relationships, but Sheldon wanted to take on a challenge by testing Leonard and my relationship. Leonard didn't want to, but I convinced him to take the test. We got an eight-point-two, but Leonard assured me that our score doesn't matter and that he just wants to hold my hand and face the scary idea of marriage together. Amy was happy to hear that.\nI remember being at the Angels Stadium with Raj, Leonard, Sheldon, Amy, and Bernadette. Howard was throwing the first pitch, but instead of a ball, he introduced his Mars Rover prototype. The pitch was slow, and the crowd tried to make it go faster by booing. Sheldon suggested going to Disneyland while waiting for the pitch to end.\nI met Howard, Bernadette, Raj, Sheldon and Emily at their apartment. They were talking about Stuart, who lives with Howard's mom and has seven HBOs. I found out that Emily is a dermatologist and Penny is training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep. Sheldon made an awkward joke about his freckles and Emily agreed to look at them. Amy made a sarcastic comment about Sheldon's relationship with Penny.\nI talked to Bernadette and Amy about Emily, but I got the sense that she didn't like me. Bernadette said I was worrying for no reason and brought up my high school P.E. teacher, who liked me a little too much. Amy asked if anyone has ever said they hated me to my face, but didn't actually say it.",

Then, I had a weird conversation with Sheldon about string theory. I tried to lighten the mood with jokes, but he didn't get them and even corrected my grammar. At least I got a good laugh out of it. Sheldon always entertains me with his quirks.\nWe were all discussing the idea of creating super soldiers by impregnating women with animals.

Leonard and Penny agreed that it's for the best that Sheldon took a sabbatical.

I went to Howard and Bernadette's apartment and talked to Bernadette about my nervousness for a pharmaceutical sales job interview. She boosted my confidence and convinced me to go. Bernadette suggested it was similar to being a waitress and the main role would be selling their antidepressants. I felt unprepared but Bernadette reminded me she wouldn't have recommended me if she didn't think I could handle it. Dan asked me why I thought I'd be a good pharmaceutical sales rep. I told him I'm a people person and my previous job as a waitress prepared me for sales. Dan mentioned having an insulin pump and I said \"people\" way too many times. I went to a pharmaceutical company office for an interview, but I didn't do well. Dan asked me how to convince physicians to switch to their drug. I made a joke about washing cars in a bikini and apologized for wasting his time. I asked him not to tell Bernadette about my bad interview because I'm scared of her. Surprisingly, Dan was scared of Bernadette too and said that she's a bully. He shared an experience where he had to tell her that they were cutting the funding for a drug she was developing but he couldn't do it. We both decided not to tell Bernadette about our conversation.

He was worried they were getting too chummy and I teased him about being replaced as her son. I visited Howard\u2019s mom's house with Howard, and Stuart surprised us by still living there with his girlfriend Debbie. While we were talking, Mrs. Wolowitz called for Stuart to help her find her glasses. Howard and Raj criticized Stuart for not informing Howard about his living arrangement earlier. Howard and I were talking about a guy in his thirties who's living with his mother. Howard found it weird and asked if I thought it was odd, to which I said that it wasn't necessarily weird because they're both adults and might just need each other's company. We joked around and left a message on their answering machine.\nI remember a conversation among us about creating supersoldiers by impregnating women with gorillas, and we discussed other animals as well like hippos, koalas, and owls. Then we talked about Penny's new job and Bernadette asked her to look over some materials, which made things a bit awkward before we moved on to discussing teacher's pets.\nRaj discussed couple's nicknames with Howard and Leonard while Sheldon complained about having to teach a class and joked about failing his students.\nSheldon's class was cancelled because no one signed up. He blames it on his obnoxious reputation. He brought cookies and was going to play a trick. Howard tries to join but Sheldon doesn't think he can handle the material. They argue about which field is smarter.\nI remember Sheldon worrying about his uvula having an STD which Leonard assures him isn't true. Howard and Sheldon have a heated argument about a class Howard dropped and the sanctity of Sheldon's mouth. They try to quiz each other about topics they are not familiar with. Howard asks Sheldon about quantifying the strength of materials and preventing eddy currents in a transformer. Leonard asks Howard to give Sheldon a hard question, but Howard thinks the previous ones were tough enough. Sheldon manages to answer Howard's last question though.\nLeonard asked a question and I answered correctly. We all cheered. Howard asked another question and we all answered together. Leonard thinks we're smart. Then, we talked about why we didn't have girlfriends in high school.\nI heckled Howard while they were playing baseball, and Sheldon joined in.

She threatened divorce when we suggested using our vacation time to take care of her.\nI suggested to Stuart that he could earn some money by getting humiliated verbally. Raj was going to let Stuart stay the night but has to cancel with Emily. Stuart also complained about everyone sounding like insurance companies, police, firemen or therapists.\nI helped Stu take care of Mrs Wolowitz and we're leaving now. Stu loves her and even calls her Debbie. Something feels weird about it but I'm not sure why.\nI gave Raj a lift to work while his car windows were being untinted. We briefly discussed my mom's care and her previous caretaker, Stuart, who had become a little too chummy with her. Raj made some inappropriate jokes, but I quickly shut them down with my love for my mother. I went to see my mom at her house with Raj and found Stuart there. He said he didn't move out as he and his girlfriend like having him there. My mom then called out for her glasses and Stuart went to help her. Raj suggested I call my mom more often. I was in my car with Raj and we were talking about my living situation with my mother. Raj thought it was weird, but justified it because my mother was lonely and the guy needed a place to stay. I asked if he would be okay if I slept with his mom, but he gave me his blessing. In the end, I decided to call my mother and be honest with her. Stuart's voicemail answered and we left a message. Bernadette told me that Penny got a job because the interviewer loves her. Stuart came over and asked to stay at my mom's but I think it's weird that he's living there rent-free. We argued, but it ended with Stuart storming out and me making a sarcastic remark.\nSo, Sheldon brought up Stalin trying to make supersoldiers with gorillas, and we all had some interesting animal suggestions.

Sheldon sensed some awkwardness, but Leonard made a joke about being a teacher's pet.\nI was stimulating the pleasure cells of a starfish before going to lunch with Penny.

Penny convinced Leonard to let me go, and I left with their blessing.\nI found myself at a railway station without trousers, desperately conveying my intelligence as a physicist. Leonard, despite being occupied with Penny, agreed to assist. Officer Hernandez had no leads on my possessions, so I proposed a fresh perspective inspired by Sherlock Holmes. Amidst a debate about ketchup brands, Amy expressed frustration, leading me to confide in Leonard about potentially ending things with her. After my journey, Leonard and Amy reminded me of my accomplishments. Yet Penny's overpowering hair overwhelmed me, prompting my departure. Unfortunately, I lost my phone. These meticulously recorded details chronicle my travels.\nAs Sheldon, I had a conversation with Howard, Raj, Amy, Leonard, Penny, and Bernadette about the possibility of creating interspecies supersoldiers. We discussed using gorillas, hippos, owls, and koalas, but ultimately settled on cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. The conversation then shifted to Penny's new job in pharmaceutical sales, and there was some perceived awkwardness between her and Bernadette about reviewing the materials. Leonard made a quip about being a teacher's pet, which reminded us of a time when Ms. McDonald forgot a quiz.\nI had an awful meeting with human resources. They made me a junior professor and required me to teach a class. Leonard thinks the kids will love me because I enjoy telling people they're wrong and giving grades. Howard thinks I love the sound of my own voice. Raj asked why it's bad that I have to teach.\nLeonard, Howard, and Raj came to check on my class, but no one signed up because apparently I have a reputation for being obnoxious. Howard wanted to take my class, but I refused since it's a graduate-level physics class, and I don't think he'd understand a single thing I was talking about.\n\"Amy interrupted me while I was trying to prepare my lesson plan, and started talking about her conversation with Bernadette and Penny. I told her to stop and focus. She then jokingly threatened me about dating the popular girl.\"\nI was up late working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz. Leonard questioned why I try so hard to prove that I'm smarter than him. He thinks it's because I'm scared of someone being smarter than me. I asked him how I can use Howard's peanut allergy against him.\nHoward expressed concern that I may be trying to belittle him by making our class unnecessarily hard. I assured him that we both can benefit from this experience and we proceeded with the class. However, Howard's behavior became disruptive, starting with his singing and culminating in shooting a spitball at me.\nI was at Amy's lab and overheard a conversation between Amy and Penny, where Amy invited Penny to Color Me Mine but Penny declined to study for work. Then Bernadette showed up and said she couldn't come to Color Me Mine because she had promised to help Penny study. I briefly spoke to Amy before leaving.\nLeonard assured me that my uvula is not infected, but it doesn't feel innocent anymore. Howard violated the sanctity of my mouth and I reported him to human resources. Howard dropped my class, but I knew he wasn't smart enough for it anyway. He challenged me on engineering, but I proved him wrong. Thankfully, I remembered Poiseuille's law.\nI asked a question about Easter while playing a trivia game with Leonard, Raj, and Howard. We answered questions about galactic years and Archimedean solids. Then Howard asked a question for a Cadbury Creme Egg, and we all answered correctly. We celebrated our success but also pondered why we weren't popular in high school.\nHoward practiced throwing a baseball for a pitch with Leonard and Raj heckling him while Penny joined in. Sheldon reminded everyone that he was part of a Quidditch team and also insulted Howard's baseball abilities.\nI had dinner with Amy and had Cornish game hen, our waiter wasn't familiar with the history of Cornwall. I'm making up for missed date nights by inviting Penny on a double date, but it seems a double date doesn't count as two dates, so I don't really care if she comes or not.\nAt Penny's apartment, we discussed committee meeting proposals which ultimately led to us choosing to go to a pub due to the availability of Yorkshire pudding. Despite criticisms, Amy and I continue to have the superior relationship in our circle. A dispute arose between Leonard and Penny regarding her preferred wine.",

He overhears a conversation between Amy, Penny, and Bernadette, reports Howard to HR, and enjoys playing trivia games and celebrating successes with his friends.

Amongst all the chaos, he finds solace and gratitude in a serene moment in a park, enjoying the beauty of nature and the laughter of children."

We also learned about Howard's mom's troublesome nursing situation.\nI discussed my frustration with being forced to continue studying string theory with Leonard, Howard, and Raj. President Siebert called me into his office, and Howard made a rude comment about my potential future career options. Raj also made a comment about his coping mechanism when he's feeling low.\nLeonard suggested that he and Penny live together without me, which was a ridiculous idea. He wants to put Penny's happiness above mine. I was working on writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate.\nAmy made me Strawberry Quik with syrup instead of powder, which I didn't like. Leonard might not want to live with me anymore now that he's engaged to Penny. Amy suggested that I live with her, but I declined.\nStuart's comic book store caught fire, and he doesn't know when he'll be able to reopen. I offered to help him and bought a wet comic book. Stuart made a sarcastic comment about only having hundreds, which I didn't appreciate. Also, a light fell where Stuart was standing.\nLeonard tracked my phone to find me at the train station. They were worried about me leaving forever, but I needed to escape and think. Penny convinced Leonard to let me go, and I left with their blessing.\nI, Sheldon, asked a man at the railway station if he was knitting pants, but he didn't let me use his phone. I explained that I was on a journey because of various reasons and my possessions were stolen while I slept. I was wearing no trousers because I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle. I also mentioned my profession as a world-renowned physicist and explained the difference between a boson and a fermion. My legs were cold and nobody helped me. Leonard picked me up from the police station in Arizona after my things were stolen. I asked him to bring my toothbrush, mail, and a good comeback for being called chicken legs. He also considered bringing Amy with him. I went to Kingman Police Station and spoke to Officer Hernandez about my stolen belongings. I suggested using Sherlock Holmes' method of elimination, but Hernandez hadn't tried that. Asked about stolen items at the Kingman police station to Hernandez. Mentioned Sherlock Holmes and Cool Ranch Doritos to Leonard. Amy arrived, asks if I'm okay and why she came. Told her shotgun in a whisper. Leonard asked me about my trip and I told him I went to many cities, but never left the train station. He was confused and asked me why, to which I replied, \"That's where all the cool trains are.\" I also mentioned that I never had a single piece of fruit. I was playing a game with Leonard and Amy in the car. Hunt's ketchup at the Indianapolis train station. Amy got mad at me for not saying goodbye and calling Leonard instead of her. I asked for privacy to talk to Leonard and told him about my plan to have coitus with Amy. I called Leonard because I didn't want Amy to think less of me. Amy said it's okay that I'm not perfect, but then I wanted to break up with her because she hurt my feelings. I recently went on a trip and did not feel better after coming back. Leonard and Amy tried to convince me that it was still an accomplishment, and that the trip was good for me. I compared myself to Gandalf the Grey and ultimately feel renewed and ready to face any changes. When I saw Penny back, I noticed that she had changed her hair and couldn't handle it, so I left. I showed my trip photos to Penny and Leonard, and shared my experience of traveling across the country without ever leaving the train station. I almost died in a fire in Des Moines but managed to survive. Also, my photos were backed up in the Cloud after my phone got stolen.\nAs Sheldon, I had a conversation with Howard, Raj, Amy, Leonard, Penny, and Bernadette about the possibility of creating interspecies supersoldiers. We discussed using gorillas, hippos, owls, and koalas, but ultimately settled on cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. The conversation then shifted to Penny's new job in pharmaceutical sales, and there was some perceived awkwardness between her and Bernadette about reviewing the materials. Leonard made a quip about being a teacher's pet, which reminded us of a time when Ms. McDonald forgot a quiz.\nI had an awful meeting with human resources. They made me a junior professor and required me to teach a class. Leonard thinks the kids will love me because I enjoy telling people they're wrong and giving grades. Howard thinks I love the sound of my own voice. Raj asked why it's bad that I have to teach.\nLeonard, Howard, and Raj came to check on my class, but no one signed up because apparently I have a reputation for being obnoxious. Howard wanted to take my class, but I refused since it's a graduate-level physics class, and I don't think he'd understand a single thing I was talking about.",
        "summ_memory": "I am Sheldon, and I experienced various events with my friends, including Leonard's engagement to Penny, a fire at Stuart's comic book store, being forced to teach a class, and a trip where I never left the train station. I also discussed the possibility of creating supersoldiers with my friends, among other topics. Through these experiences, I faced challenges, felt frustrated, and even considered leaving, but ultimately found renewal and the strength to face changes."

Later, Bernadette and I talked about their earlier disagreement, and Sheldon was too busy to talk.\nPenny and Bernadette discussed the side effects of an erectile dysfunction drug. Penny made a joke about the side effects of sleeping with an older man. They decided to go out for a drink and invited me, Amy, to join.\nSheldon asked if I enjoyed his lecture and I replied, \"No, and neither did our waiter.\" We talked about Cornish game hen and then planned a movie night which turned into a double date with Sheldon inviting Penny.\nSheldon, Leonard, Penny, and I had a conversation about going out. Sheldon initially didn't want to go to a pub, but I suggested it and it passed as a proposal. Sheldon likes the pub because they serve Yorkshire pudding, even though he doesn't like it. He thinks he and I have a superior relationship compared to the others in our circle, which upset Leonard and Penny. They started arguing, and I made a joke about Penny talking to her drink instead of them.\nLeonard and Sheldon are arguing about their relationships being wonderful. Sheldon seems to think that their relationship is better because they enjoy spending time together while Leonard believes that they too enjoy it. Leonard taunts Sheldon about how he considers himself the best at everything. Meanwhile, Penny doesn't seem to care while Amy tries to calm things down. Sheldon defends the idea of having a contract-based relationship, and everyone ends up having a mini conversation around it. Amy adds a witty comment in the end, and the conversation finishes.\nAt the pub, Penny and Sheldon argue over sharing food while Leonard mocks their relationship. Sheldon rates everything and compares it to a Relationship Closeness Inventory, but Penny thinks it's stupid. I got a score of 8.2 out of 10 with Sheldon according to the inventory.\nI had a conversation with Sheldon, Penny, and Leonard at the pub. They were comparing relationships, but Penny and I apologized for it. Sheldon suggested taking on Koothrappali and his dog for a challenge, and Leonard defended their relationship. Sheldon suggested a test to determine their compatibility, but they were hesitant. Leonard expressed that he wants to do scary things with Penny and an eight-point-two score was achieved.\nSo, we were at Angels Stadium to watch Howard throw the first pitch, and Sheldon was not interested in the game. Amy offered to buy him cotton candy and a bobblehead to stay. Howard ended up pitching with a Mars Rover prototype, and it didn't go as planned. Sheldon wanted to leave and go to Disneyland, but we ended up waiting for the pitch to end.\nI asked Howard about Stuart and his living arrangements, but he didn't want to talk about it. Bernadette mentioned that Stuart will be living with Howard's mom. Howard complained that Stuart got more HBOs than he did growing up. Later, Raj introduced Emily, a dermatology resident, to everyone. Sheldon awkwardly joked about his buttock freckles, and Penny offered to practice her sales pitch on Emily. I couldn't help but feel annoyed at how quickly Howard's mom was accommodating Stuart's living situation, even though Howard didn't have it as good growing up.\nI remember discussing Emily with Penny and Bernadette in Penny's apartment. Penny felt like Emily didn't like her, but Bernadette reassured her. Penny also mentioned a past experience with a teacher who had a crush on her. I asked if anyone had ever told Penny they hated her to her face, but didn't say it myself because of Penny's nice cheekbones.",
        "summ_memory": "I joined my friends in various social activities, including going to Color Me Mine, having a drink at the pub, and attending a baseball game.

She bought me a brownie and ate it in the car. I have to go rub Mrs Wolowitz's belly again.\nI asked Bernadette how she was feeling, and we both agreed that we're proud to be a good team. Mrs. Wolowitz was yelling for pancakes, and a foreign nurse was taking care of her. Bernadette acknowledged that I was right, and we welcomed ourselves to Team Putz.\nHoward: My mom lost two nurses and we're having trouble finding replacements. We're trying a weird solution involving M&M's and Ambien. Leonard and Penny got engaged and there was general cheering.\nI remember a conversation at the cafeteria where Raj mentioned his hunger, which Howard jokingly attributed to his recent s*xual encounter. Sheldon was upset about being forced to continue with string theory and Leonard tried to calm him down. Raj shared his coping mechanism for when he is feeling low.\nI tried convincing the nurse to stay longer but she left. Bernadette and I were talking about how we can't handle Mrs Wolowitz alone. She threatened divorce when we suggested using our vacation time to take care of her.\nI suggested to Stuart that he could earn some money by getting humiliated verbally. Raj was going to let Stuart stay the night but has to cancel with Emily. Stuart also complained about everyone sounding like insurance companies, police, firemen or therapists.\nI helped Stu take care of Mrs Wolowitz and we're leaving now. Stu loves her and even calls her Debbie. Something feels weird about it but I'm not sure why.\nI gave Raj a lift to work while his car windows were being untinted. We briefly discussed my mom's care and her previous caretaker, Stuart, who had become a little too chummy with her. Raj made some inappropriate jokes, but I quickly shut them down with my love for my mother. I went to see my mom at her house with Raj and found Stuart there. He said he didn't move out as he and his girlfriend like having him there. My mom then called out for her glasses and Stuart went to help her. Raj suggested I call my mom more often. I was in my car with Raj and we were talking about my living situation with my mother. Raj thought it was weird, but justified it because my mother was lonely and the guy needed a place to stay. I asked if he would be okay if I slept with his mom, but he gave me his blessing. In the end, I decided to call my mother and be honest with her. Stuart's voicemail answered and we left a message. Bernadette told me that Penny got a job because the interviewer loves her. Stuart came over and asked to stay at my mom's but I think it's weird that he's living there rent-free. We argued, but it ended with Stuart storming out and me making a sarcastic remark.",

Raj suggested couple's nicknames for him and Emily, while Howard questioned the reasoning behind the names.\nLeonard and Howard were trying to see how Sheldon's class was going, but it turns out no one signed up. Sheldon brought Fig Newtons and planned to use it in a trick question about who the cookie was named after. Howard wants to take Sheldon's graduate-level physics class but Sheldon doesn't believe Howard is smart enough.\nI had a conversation with Sheldon about his lesson plan for Wolowitz. I challenged him on why he feels the need to prove he's smarter than Wolowitz. I suggested he may have emotional issues related to his need to feel intellectually superior. Sheldon then asked me how he can use Howard's peanut allergy against him.\nSheldon was worried about his uvula having an STD, but I assured him it didn't. Howard and Sheldon had a dispute over a class, and Howard challenged Sheldon's knowledge of engineering. Raj asked some questions, and Sheldon answered with confidence.\nI asked a question about a galactic year and Raj answered correctly, earning cheers from all of us. Then Howard asked a question about an Archimedean solid, and we all answered together. Raj wondered why girls didn't like us in high school, and we concluded that it was because we were awkward and couldn't play sports.\nHoward tries practicing baseball to prepare to throw out the first pitch for the Angels, but struggles at first. Raj heckles him while Sheldon reminds him of his lack of athleticism. Penny congratulates Howard on his opportunity and also pokes fun at Sheldon's Quidditch team. Overall, it's a playful scene among friends.\nSheldon boasted about his lecture to Amy who disliked it. Sheldon defended his dissatisfaction with the Cornish game hen served at a restaurant, later shared with Leonard and Penny. Sheldon and Amy planned to see a movie on a date, which led to Penny and Leonard's surprise. Sheldon tried to make up for missed dates and invited them on a double date. However, after realizing it wouldn't count as two dates, he didn't care if they joined or not.\nSheldon and Amy proposed a picnic in the park, but Sheldon added too many amendments and Amy suggested going to a pub instead. Sheldon initially opposed but changed his mind after finding out they serve Yorkshire pudding. Sheldon and Amy have a superior relationship to the rest of us. There is no official ranking, but if there was, we wouldn't be at the bottom. Penny and I bicker about what she drinks.\nThis conversation was about Sheldon comparing his relationship with Amy to mine with someone else. He claimed they have a strong relationship because they enjoy spending time together, even if they're doing different things. We argued about it, with Penny wondering why we care so much. Sheldon defended his views, referring to the U.S. Constitution as a basis for a relationship agreement. Amy eventually jokes about a fire starting in her flag underwear.\nI was at the pub with Amy, Penny, and Sheldon. Sheldon was being Sheldon, quantifying everything. He refused to share his food with Amy because it had avocado. Penny didn't want to take the Relationship Closeness Inventory, but Sheldon and Amy got an 8.2 out of 10. Penny left to get another drink.\nLeonard asked Penny if she was mad at him at the pub. She said no but expressed her worry that they are engaged and have nothing in common. Leonard admitted that he is also scared about that. They both agreed that they are afraid their marriage will be a disaster. They also both think that Leonard is not funny.\nWe were at the pub and Penny and Amy apologized for comparing relationships. Sheldon suggested we take a test to see if we were a good couple.

Sheldon and Amy planned a movie night and invited Penny for a double date, but Sheldon didn't care if she came or not.\nSheldon and Amy wanted to have a picnic in a park, but Sheldon shot down the proposal. Amy suggested a pub which Sheldon agreed to after seeing Yorkshire pudding on the menu. Leonard made a joke about their relationship. Sheldon claimed that his and Amy's relationship was the best in the group. Leonard and Penny were at the bottom of the \"relationship rank\". We had a small argument with a joke about wine.\nSo, Leonard and Sheldon were arguing about their relationships and Sheldon brought up the U.S. Constitution. Amy made a funny comment about setting her flag underwear on fire.\nWe were at the pub and Sheldon refused to share his burger with me because I'm allergic to avocado. He kept assigning random numbers to things, even relationships. Amy mentioned the Relationship Closeness Inventory and we ended up taking the test. Leonard insisted on it even though I didn't want to.\nLeonard asked if I was mad at him, but I said no. He then asked if it was about the test or us. I told him I was worried that we're engaged and have nothing in common, and that scares me. Leonard admitted that it scares him too sometimes. He tried to make me feel better by saying we both think he's not funny and we're both scared our marriage will be a disaster.\nI apologized to Amy at the pub for comparing relationships, but Sheldon wanted to take on a challenge by testing Leonard and my relationship. Leonard didn't want to, but I convinced him to take the test. We got an eight-point-two, but Leonard assured me that our score doesn't matter and that he just wants to hold my hand and face the scary idea of marriage together. Amy was happy to hear that.\nI remember being at the Angels Stadium with Raj, Leonard, Sheldon, Amy, and Bernadette. Howard was throwing the first pitch, but instead of a ball, he introduced his Mars Rover prototype. The pitch was slow, and the crowd tried to make it go faster by booing. Sheldon suggested going to Disneyland while waiting for the pitch to end.\nI met Howard, Bernadette, Raj, Sheldon and Emily at their apartment. They were talking about Stuart, who lives with Howard's mom and has seven HBOs. I found out that Emily is a dermatologist and Penny is training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep. Sheldon made an awkward joke about his freckles and Emily agreed to look at them. Amy made a sarcastic comment about Sheldon's relationship with Penny.\nI talked to Bernadette and Amy about Emily, but I got the sense that she didn't like me. Bernadette said I was worrying for no reason and brought up my high school P.E. teacher, who liked me a little too much. Amy asked if anyone has ever said they hated me to my face, but didn't actually say it.\nI remember that we were discussing ways to get more kids into the comic book store, and someone suggested using a van to pick them up. Then Raj mentioned something about telling everyone we hooked up, which I didn't appreciate, and Sheldon made a joke about losing friends.\nAmy and Bernadette were trying to cheer me up about a girl who doesn't like me. Amy suggested pretending to be her friend until she likes me, but I said it wouldn't work. Bernadette said I should use my sales training to sell myself, but I thought it was stupid. We all joked around and reminisced about how Amy and I didn't used to be friends.\nLeonard asked if it's okay to invest in Stuart\u2019s comic book store because it's a big deal financially and we're engaged. I asked if he considers credit card debt a big deal financially.\nRaj and Emily visited my apartment, where Emily apologized for being rude. Raj expressed his desire for all of us to get along, but I assured them that what happened between Raj and me was in the past. Emily and I complimented each other's looks, and Raj clumsily joked about his single life.",

Howard surprised us all by using a Mars Rover prototype to deliver the pitch instead. The pitch went slow causing someone in the crowd to heckle him. While waiting for the pitch to be delivered, Sheldon suggested going to Disneyland to play hide and seek on Tom Sawyer's Island.\nLeonard mentioned a research team creating a dinosaur chicken, which I found intriguing. Howard questioned my interest because I was afraid of both animals. Raj asked about our plans for the upcoming night and Leonard brought up a study on losing friends when starting a new romantic relationship. Raj disagreed and said he wouldn't drop his friends, but joked about the consequences of a potential breakup.\nMet Raj's girlfriend Emily, she's a dermatology resident. Bernadette suggested that Penny practice her pharmaceutical sales pitch on Emily. I asked Emily to look at some odd freckles on my buttocks, to which she reluctantly agreed. Amy made a joke about our relationship compared to Raj's.\nI was at Capital Comics with my friends and we were discussing Stuart's place. Howard expressed his dislike of the current store and missing Stuart's old store. Leonard joked about Howard's love for HBOs. Raj brought up the fact that Stuart might not be able to reopen because he didn't get enough money from the insurance company. I shared my frustrations with insurance companies. Leonard suggested that we put up the rest of the money to help Stuart reopen and become owners of a comic book store. We joked about competing with the current store and I suggested a humorous business plan.\nIn a discussion with Leonard, Howard, and Raj, we talked about different ways to stand out in competition. We came up with a plan to pick kids up from parks and schools in a van. Later, Raj mentioned to Penny that we hooked up, and I made a comment on losing friends.\nHoward and I discussed opening our own comic book store, where we could have fun interactions with customers. Leonard brought up Penny's infamous list and I joked about her still wading through it. We also discussed the importance of honesty and how it can affect relationships.\nI asked Amy for her opinion on investing in Stuart's comic book store, stressing the importance of enthusiastic support. Amy expressed concern, but ultimately praised the idea. I then mentioned our van.\nI remember discussing our disappointment about not having our own comic book store with Raj, Leonard, and Howard. We were all looking forward to having a place where we could sit, read comics and enjoy snacks in peace. But unfortunately, it turned out to be too good to be true, and we all sighed in disappointment.\nI remember being in the cafeteria with Raj, Leonard, and Howard. Raj brought up the idea of converting footsteps to electromagnetic energy. Leonard mentioned that they had that idea years ago, but it never went anywhere. I pointed out that Leonard became distracted by Penny and listed his recent accomplishments. We then discussed having a science retreat to brainstorm ideas, but I objected to going to a cabin, hotel, or lake house due to horror movies.\nLeonard, Howard, Raj, and I were in the apartment discussing ideas, and we got sidetracked when Howard made a joke about Raj's girlfriend. We then started brainstorming ideas and ended up talking about inventions that can be used for sex until we decided to focus on something new. We talked about how science fiction can inspire real-life inventions, and we discussed the possibility of creating the hoverboard from \"Back to the Future II.\" Raj volunteered to make popcorn for us while we watched the movie.\nI remember Howard, Leonard, and Raj discussing the time travel paradox and the movie Hot Tub Time Machine. We talked about the correct tense for events affected by time travel and the impact on the timeline. We also went on a tangent about Biff's name and sausage wrapped Pillsbury dough. All while attempting to focus without the girls present.",

Sheldon got robbed and Leonard went to pick him up in Arizona. Leonard asked me to go with him, but I couldn't because of a job interview. I talked to Bernadette about it and she reassured me. I went for the interview and had an awkward conversation with Dan. Then, I had a weird conversation with Sheldon about string theory.

I mentioned that headaches, dizziness, and nausea could occur, to which she agreed. I made a joke about those same symptoms happening if an elderly man with an erection climbed on top of you.

They also both think that Leonard is not funny.\nWe were at the pub and Penny and Amy apologized for comparing relationships. Sheldon suggested we take a test to see if we were a good couple. I didn't want to, but Penny insisted. I said I didn't care about our score, I just wanted to marry her. Amy was happy with what I said and Sheldon claimed we got an eight-point-two.\nI remember being at Angels Stadium with Raj, Penny, Sheldon, Amy, and Bernadette. Howard threw the first pitch, but instead of a regular pitch, he used a Mars Rover prototype that was going too slow, causing the crowd to boo. Sheldon wanted to leave to go to Disneyland but was promised cotton candy and a bobblehead if he stayed.\nI was chatting with Sheldon, Howard and Raj about the possibility of transgenic chicken dinosaurs. Sheldon made a joke about it, and then brought up a study about losing friends when entering into a new relationship. We also discussed Raj's upcoming date and possible friendship fallout.\nWe were at Howard's apartment and his mom got Stuart cable with seven HBOs. Raj introduced us to Emily, who is a dermatologist, and Sheldon asked her to check his freckles. Penny talked about her pharmaceutical sales training and we all had a good laugh.\nSo, Howard and Sheldon were complaining about the current comic book store and missing Stuart's place. Howard mentioned that Stuart might not reopen due to insurance money issues. Then, I suggested that we put in the rest of the money that Stuart needs and become owners of a comic book store. Raj proposed a business plan to compete with the current store, and Sheldon jokingly suggested a plan involving genital warts.\nWe were discussing ways to set our comic book store apart from the competition. Howard suggested that we get a van and pick kids up to bring them to the store. Penny got upset when Raj told Emily they hooked up, even though they just fooled around while drunk. Sheldon joked about losing friends, but Raj said he would never lose Sheldon as a friend.",
        "summ_memory": "I have a collection of memories with my friends. We had playful disputes and talks about relationships, movies, and books. We also discussed business plans for a comic book store and ways to set it apart from the competition. We went to a baseball game, a pub, and Howard's apartment, and had good laughs over Sheldon's jokes and quirky behaviors. Overall, we had a good time together, and despite our differences, we value each other's friendship."

We both acknowledged that time would pass quickly. I went to the Kingman Police Station to see Sheldon, my boyfriend. He seemed alright, but mentioned something about using Cool Ranch Doritos instead of cocaine. Leonard was there too. When I asked him why I came, he said he had something to tell me but whispered it instead; he said \"shotgun.\" Sheldon and Leonard were discussing ketchup brands at different train stations. Sheldon then brought up calling Leonard for help and not saying goodbye to Amy. Amy was upset about this and asked for privacy to talk to Sheldon. Sheldon then told Leonard about wanting to have coitus with Amy and called himself a failure for not being able to do something on his own. Amy reassured him that it's okay and that he doesn't need to be perfect. Sheldon then said he wants to break up with her. Sheldon is feeling down about his trip but Leonard reminds him that he accomplished something. Amy chimes in and says that the mishaps make it an adventure.

We talked about Bernadette and how she's been bugging Penny since helping her get the job. I mentioned that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between friends.\nI told Sheldon about a funny situation with Penny and Bernadette after drinks.

Later, Bernadette and I talked about their earlier disagreement, and Sheldon was too busy to talk.\nPenny and Bernadette discussed the side effects of an erectile dysfunction drug. Penny made a joke about the side effects of sleeping with an older man. They decided to go out for a drink and invited me, Amy, to join.\nSheldon asked if I enjoyed his lecture and I replied, \"No, and neither did our waiter.\" We talked about Cornish game hen and then planned a movie night which turned into a double date with Sheldon inviting Penny.\nSheldon, Leonard, Penny, and I had a conversation about going out. Sheldon initially didn't want to go to a pub, but I suggested it and it passed as a proposal. Sheldon likes the pub because they serve Yorkshire pudding, even though he doesn't like it. He thinks he and I have a superior relationship compared to the others in our circle, which upset Leonard and Penny. They started arguing, and I made a joke about Penny talking to her drink instead of them.\nLeonard and Sheldon are arguing about their relationships being wonderful. Sheldon seems to think that their relationship is better because they enjoy spending time together while Leonard believes that they too enjoy it. Leonard taunts Sheldon about how he considers himself the best at everything. Meanwhile, Penny doesn't seem to care while Amy tries to calm things down. Sheldon defends the idea of having a contract-based relationship, and everyone ends up having a mini conversation around it. Amy adds a witty comment in the end, and the conversation finishes.",

However, Penny thinks it may be good for him to go on his trip. Ultimately, we let Sheldon go and wished him luck.\nAmy updated Sheldon's condition and we agreed that the sabbatical worked in his favor. Penny thinks this will be for the best. Amy questioned why Sheldon was let go.\nSheldon got robbed and called me to pick him up from a police station in Arizona. He needs me to bring pants, toothbrush, and mail. Penny couldn't come with me because of her job interview. She didn't object to me inviting Amy along. I remember thanking someone for coming to my car and offering to accompany me on a long journey. We discussed their boyfriend being in trouble and how they were not angry that he called me instead of them. The person said it was their pleasure to join me, and we agreed that time would fly by. I remember being at the Kingman Police Station with Sheldon and Hernandez. Sheldon mentions Sherlock Holmes and Cool Ranch Doritos, which prompts me to say his name. Then, Amy enters and asks if he's okay. Sheldon seems surprised and asks why she came. When she asks if he has anything else to say, he whispers \"shotgun.\" Leonard asks Sheldon about his travels and is surprised to learn that Sheldon never left any of the train stations he visited and didn't have any fruit. Sheldon and I were in the car talking about ketchup at different train stations. Amy was with us but was upset that Sheldon didn't say goodbye before leaving town and called me for help instead of her. Sheldon wanted privacy to talk to me about wanting to have sex with Amy and why he called me instead of her. Amy was frustrated and stopped listening. Sheldon eventually admits to calling me because he didn't want Amy to think less of him and was worried about breaking up with her. I was with Sheldon and Amy in the stairwell, discussing Sheldon's recent train trip. Amy tried to point out the positive aspects, while Sheldon likened himself to Gandalf the Grey. When Penny arrived, Sheldon got overwhelmed and left. Sheldon showed us his travel pictures, which were backed up to the Cloud. Leonard made a joke about silver linings. Sheldon had travelled the entire country but never got off the train, and even almost died in a fire.\nDuring a conversation, Sheldon brought up the topic of Joseph Stalin's attempt to create supersoldiers by impregnating women with gorillas.

Later, when Bernadette asked Penny about her new job in pharmaceutical sales, Sheldon sensed some tension, and we joked about being teacher's pets in school.\nI remember discussing Sheldon's new junior professor job, and how he's not too thrilled about teaching. Raj suggested couple's nicknames for him and Emily, while Howard questioned the reasoning behind the names.\nLeonard and Howard were trying to see how Sheldon's class was going, but it turns out no one signed up. Sheldon brought Fig Newtons and planned to use it in a trick question about who the cookie was named after. Howard wants to take Sheldon's graduate-level physics class but Sheldon doesn't believe Howard is smart enough.\nI had a conversation with Sheldon about his lesson plan for Wolowitz.

Howard and Sheldon had a dispute over a class, and Howard challenged Sheldon's knowledge of engineering. Raj asked some questions, and Sheldon answered with confidence.\nI asked a question about a galactic year and Raj answered correctly, earning cheers from all of us. Then Howard asked a question about an Archimedean solid, and we all answered together. Raj wondered why girls didn't like us in high school, and we concluded that it was because we were awkward and couldn't play sports.\nHoward tries practicing baseball to prepare to throw out the first pitch for the Angels, but struggles at first. Raj heckles him while Sheldon reminds him of his lack of athleticism. Penny congratulates Howard on his opportunity and also pokes fun at Sheldon's Quidditch team. Overall, it's a playful scene among friends.\nSheldon boasted about his lecture to Amy who disliked it. Sheldon defended his dissatisfaction with the Cornish game hen served at a restaurant, later shared with Leonard and Penny.

We also learned about Howard's mom's troublesome nursing situation.\nI discussed my frustration with being forced to continue studying string theory with Leonard, Howard, and Raj. President Siebert called me into his office, and Howard made a rude comment about my potential future career options. Raj also made a comment about his coping mechanism when he's feeling low.\nLeonard suggested that he and Penny live together without me, which was a ridiculous idea. He wants to put Penny's happiness above mine. I was working on writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate.\nAmy made me Strawberry Quik with syrup instead of powder, which I didn't like. Leonard might not want to live with me anymore now that he's engaged to Penny. Amy suggested that I live with her, but I declined.\nStuart's comic book store caught fire, and he doesn't know when he'll be able to reopen. I offered to help him and bought a wet comic book. Stuart made a sarcastic comment about only having hundreds, which I didn't appreciate. Also, a light fell where Stuart was standing.\nLeonard tracked my phone to find me at the train station. They were worried about me leaving forever, but I needed to escape and think. Penny convinced Leonard to let me go, and I left with their blessing.\nI, Sheldon, asked a man at the railway station if he was knitting pants, but he didn't let me use his phone. I explained that I was on a journey because of various reasons and my possessions were stolen while I slept. I was wearing no trousers because I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle. I also mentioned my profession as a world-renowned physicist and explained the difference between a boson and a fermion. My legs were cold and nobody helped me. Leonard picked me up from the police station in Arizona after my things were stolen. I asked him to bring my toothbrush, mail, and a good comeback for being called chicken legs. He also considered bringing Amy with him. I went to Kingman Police Station and spoke to Officer Hernandez about my stolen belongings. I suggested using Sherlock Holmes' method of elimination, but Hernandez hadn't tried that. Asked about stolen items at the Kingman police station to Hernandez. Mentioned Sherlock Holmes and Cool Ranch Doritos to Leonard. Amy arrived, asks if I'm okay and why she came. Told her shotgun in a whisper. Leonard asked me about my trip and I told him I went to many cities, but never left the train station. He was confused and asked me why, to which I replied, \"That's where all the cool trains are.\" I also mentioned that I never had a single piece of fruit. I was playing a game with Leonard and Amy in the car. Hunt's ketchup at the Indianapolis train station. Amy got mad at me for not saying goodbye and calling Leonard instead of her. I asked for privacy to talk to Leonard and told him about my plan to have coitus with Amy. I called Leonard because I didn't want Amy to think less of me. Amy said it's okay that I'm not perfect, but then I wanted to break up with her because she hurt my feelings. I recently went on a trip and did not feel better after coming back. Leonard and Amy tried to convince me that it was still an accomplishment, and that the trip was good for me. I compared myself to Gandalf the Grey and ultimately feel renewed and ready to face any changes. When I saw Penny back, I noticed that she had changed her hair and couldn't handle it, so I left. I showed my trip photos to Penny and Leonard, and shared my experience of traveling across the country without ever leaving the train station. I almost died in a fire in Des Moines but managed to survive. Also, my photos were backed up in the Cloud after my phone got stolen.\nAs Sheldon, I had a conversation with Howard, Raj, Amy, Leonard, Penny, and Bernadette about the possibility of creating interspecies supersoldiers. We discussed using gorillas, hippos, owls, and koalas, but ultimately settled on cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. The conversation then shifted to Penny's new job in pharmaceutical sales, and there was some perceived awkwardness between her and Bernadette about reviewing the materials. Leonard made a quip about being a teacher's pet, which reminded us of a time when Ms. McDonald forgot a quiz.",

I assured him that we both can benefit from this experience and we proceeded with the class. However, Howard's behavior became disruptive, starting with his singing and culminating in shooting a spitball at me.\nI was at Amy's lab and overheard a conversation between Amy and Penny, where Amy invited Penny to Color Me Mine but Penny declined to study for work. Then Bernadette showed up and said she couldn't come to Color Me Mine because she had promised to help Penny study.

Sheldon reminded everyone that he was part of a Quidditch team and also insulted Howard's baseball abilities.\nI had dinner with Amy and had Cornish game hen, our waiter wasn't familiar with the history of Cornwall. I'm making up for missed date nights by inviting Penny on a double date, but it seems a double date doesn't count as two dates, so I don't really care if she comes or not.\nAt Penny's apartment, we discussed committee meeting proposals which ultimately led to us choosing to go to a pub due to the availability of Yorkshire pudding. Despite criticisms, Amy and I continue to have the superior relationship in our circle. A dispute arose between Leonard and Penny regarding her preferred wine.\nLeonard questioned why our relationship is wonderful and theirs is not. I said we enjoy spending time together, even if it's parallel play. Penny asked why Leonard cared. Leonard criticized our relationship agreement, but I defended it with a reference to the U.S. Constitution. Amy made a joking remark.\nAt the pub, we discussed relationships and rated them using the Relationship Closeness Inventory. Leonard and Penny scored poorly, while Amy and I scored an impressive 8.2. Leonard wanted to take the quiz, but Penny thought it was stupid. Amy even joked that our outing counted as two dates.\nI suggested taking on Koothrappali and his dog after winning a comparison with Penny and Amy's relationships. Leonard emphasized that being different doesn't mean we're a bad couple and Penny agreed to take the test, despite Leonard's apprehension. But it doesn't matter what the score is, as it only makes Leonard more determined to marry Penny.\nI remember being at Angels Stadium with Raj, Penny, Leonard, Amy, and Bernadette to watch Howard throw out the first pitch. Howard surprised us all by using a Mars Rover prototype to deliver the pitch instead. The pitch went slow causing someone in the crowd to heckle him. While waiting for the pitch to be delivered, Sheldon suggested going to Disneyland to play hide and seek on Tom Sawyer's Island.\nLeonard mentioned a research team creating a dinosaur chicken, which I found intriguing. Howard questioned my interest because I was afraid of both animals. Raj asked about our plans for the upcoming night and Leonard brought up a study on losing friends when starting a new romantic relationship. Raj disagreed and said he wouldn't drop his friends, but joked about the consequences of a potential breakup.",

Their discussions covered various topics, including Penny's new job and plans for a movie night and a double date. Later on, someone handed me a warm cup of coffee, instantly transporting me back to a caf\u00e9 in Paris, evoking memories of sipping coffee and watching bustling streets, reminding me of the beauty in simple moments."

Amy teased me about Bernadette riding me like a bicycle, but I think she just wants to help me succeed. Bernadette apologized for being too hard on me and we're good now. Sheldon was too busy with a spitball to talk.\nBernadette and I were discussing potential side effects of an erectile dysfunction drug. I mentioned that headaches, dizziness, and nausea could occur, to which she agreed. I made a joke about those same symptoms happening if an elderly man with an erection climbed on top of you. Bernadette offered to stop but I was okay to continue. We decided to go for a drink and call Amy to join us. Amy greeted us when we called her.\nHoward was practicing throwing a ball for a baseball game. Raj heckled him and Sheldon made fun of him for not being picked for a team.

We had a small argument with a joke about wine.\nSo, Leonard and Sheldon were arguing about their relationships and Sheldon brought up the U.S. Constitution. Amy made a funny comment about setting her flag underwear on fire.\nWe were at the pub and Sheldon refused to share his burger with me because I'm allergic to avocado. He kept assigning random numbers to things, even relationships. Amy mentioned the Relationship Closeness Inventory and we ended up taking the test. Leonard insisted on it even though I didn't want to.\nLeonard asked if I was mad at him, but I said no. He then asked if it was about the test or us. I told him I was worried that we're engaged and have nothing in common, and that scares me. Leonard admitted that it scares him too sometimes. He tried to make me feel better by saying we both think he's not funny and we're both scared our marriage will be a disaster.\nI apologized to Amy at the pub for comparing relationships, but Sheldon wanted to take on a challenge by testing Leonard and my relationship. Leonard didn't want to, but I convinced him to take the test. We got an eight-point-two, but Leonard assured me that our score doesn't matter and that he just wants to hold my hand and face the scary idea of marriage together. Amy was happy to hear that.\nI remember being at the Angels Stadium with Raj, Leonard, Sheldon, Amy, and Bernadette. Howard was throwing the first pitch, but instead of a ball, he introduced his Mars Rover prototype. The pitch was slow, and the crowd tried to make it go faster by booing. Sheldon suggested going to Disneyland while waiting for the pitch to end.\nI met Howard, Bernadette, Raj, Sheldon and Emily at their apartment. They were talking about Stuart, who lives with Howard's mom and has seven HBOs. I found out that Emily is a dermatologist and Penny is training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep. Sheldon made an awkward joke about his freckles and Emily agreed to look at them. Amy made a sarcastic comment about Sheldon's relationship with Penny.\nI talked to Bernadette and Amy about Emily, but I got the sense that she didn't like me. Bernadette said I was worrying for no reason and brought up my high school P.E. teacher, who liked me a little too much. Amy asked if anyone has ever said they hated me to my face, but didn't actually say it.\nI remember that we were discussing ways to get more kids into the comic book store, and someone suggested using a van to pick them up. Then Raj mentioned something about telling everyone we hooked up, which I didn't appreciate, and Sheldon made a joke about losing friends.",

We also learnt that they weren't quitting on their own. Penny and I announced our engagement, which took everyone by surprise. But hey, it was a happy moment and we had a great time celebrating.\nI was at the cafeteria with Raj, Howard, and Sheldon. Raj was feeling hungry, and we joked about the possible reasons. Sheldon was upset about being forced to continue with string theory, and Howard suggested a job in home care. Raj had his own way of dealing with low moods.\nI told my mom about my engagement, but she already knew thanks to Sheldon. She didn't seem too enthusiastic about it, but said if Penny is good enough for Sheldon, then she's good enough for her. I expressed my frustration with how much my mom talks to Sheldon instead of me. She also said I should work on wanting her approval.\nI talked to Sheldon about our living arrangements now that Penny and I are engaged. He offered to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period, but we were thinking more of us living together without him. He didn't understand why we would suggest such a thing, and I told him it's because I love Penny and want to give her the life she deserves.\nI cooked for Penny and we discussed setting a date, but it depends on her brother's schedule. Amy came over looking for Sheldon and we talked about his need for alone time. Penny kicked Amy out after she asked about the food.\nI was worried about Sheldon and asked Penny if she thinks he's okay. I tracked his phone and found out he was at the train station alone at night, which I didn't like. Penny and I decided to go get him. It's not just about looking out for him, but also avoiding the wrath of my mother.\nI tracked Sheldon's phone to the train station where he wanted to leave forever, but Penny and I convinced him to come home. However, Penny thinks it may be good for him to go on his trip. Ultimately, we let Sheldon go and wished him luck.\nAmy updated Sheldon's condition and we agreed that the sabbatical worked in his favor. Penny thinks this will be for the best. Amy questioned why Sheldon was let go.\nI walked into the apartment and Penny asked about yoga. I declined, needing coffee first. Sheldon called from a police station and needed help. I asked Penny to come, but she had a job interview. I invited Amy and she joined me in the car. Sheldon and I arrived at the police station. Sheldon made a strange comment about Sherlock Holmes and Cool Ranch Doritos. Amy asked why he didn't show more gratitude. Sheldon whispered \"Shotgun.\" Sheldon then listed cities he never visited, content with just being at the train station. We had a heated discussion about condiments. Sheldon confessed his fear of disappointing Amy and suggested breaking up. He expressed regret in the stairwell. Sheldon couldn't handle Penny's new hairstyle and abruptly left. Sheldon showed us pictures from his trip, despite losing his phone. Sheldon shared a harrowing experience in Des Moines.\nDuring a conversation, Sheldon brought up the topic of Joseph Stalin's attempt to create supersoldiers by impregnating women with gorillas. The rest of us discussed what other animals would be suitable for this purpose. Later, when Bernadette asked Penny about her new job in pharmaceutical sales, Sheldon sensed some tension, and we joked about being teacher's pets in school.",
        "summ_memory": "I proposed to Penny despite a monkey hair mishap. We celebrated with friends and discussed living arrangements with Sheldon. My mom's preference for Sheldon frustrated me. Sheldon had a breakdown, but Penny and I convinced him to stay. We eventually let Sheldon go on a trip and helped him with a police incident. Amidst it all, I had a vivid memory of a serene beach sunset, with warm sand, crashing waves, and a breathtaking sky. It was a moment of pure bliss, a reminder of simplicity's beauty."

I started singing when I realized he wasn't a good teacher, and even made a spitball to shoot at him. Accidentally hit him in the mouth with it.\nI argued with Sheldon about dropping his class and violating the sanctity of his mouth. We quizzed each other on technicalities; I gave him a hard time, but he managed to keep up.\nLeonard, Raj, Sheldon, and I were hanging out at the apartment, playing a trivia game. We answered some tough questions and felt pretty smart. We also joked about why girls didn't like us in high school. Good times.\nI was practicing throwing a baseball because I'm going to throw out the first pitch at an Angels game as an astronaut. Raj was heckling me and Sheldon joined in, reminding me of my lack of athletic ability. Penny came out and congratulated me, calling me the athlete of the group. Sheldon bragged about his Quidditch team and Penny made a joke about it. Eventually, I threw the ball while Raj continued to heckle me.\nRaj asked if I ever played baseball as a kid, but I threw my arm out the day of tryouts because of my dad's Playboy collection. Bernadette tested our distance from home plate to the pitcher mound, and I couldn't believe it when we finally reached the sixty feet mark.\nBernadette gave me some terrible advice for throwing a ball at the gym. Raj was there trying to encourage me, but Bernadette just kept telling me to throw the ball without any helpful tips.\nAt the gym, Raj thinks he's getting better, Bernadette thinks it's too late for him to cancel, and I had to give a warning.\nI threw the first pitch at Angel Stadium, but instead of a ball, I presented a working prototype of the Mars Rover, since I am a scientist. I also remember Sheldon wanting to leave to go to Disneyland but ended up staying to watch.\nLeonard mentioned a team trying to create a chicken dinosaur through DNA manipulation.

Raj insisted he wouldn't drop his friends if his girlfriend didn't like them, but joked that they would eventually be dead to him if they didn't remain close.\nAmy asked about Stuart, but I didn't wanna talk about it. Bernadette said he's still living with my mom, and I complained about all the HBOs he got from my mother. Then Raj, Sheldon, Leonard, and Penny came over.

Oh, and there was some awkwardness.\nRaj was trying to come up with a cute couple's nickname, while Sheldon didn't enjoy being made to teach a class, despite Leonard pointing out its advantages.\nI remember trying to convince Sheldon that I was smart enough to take his graduate-level physics class, but he kept throwing difficult questions at me. Raj was there with cookies and Leonard and Howard were watching.\nSheldon and I were in a classroom, about to start a class. I told him that if he intends to make this class difficult, I'm out. If not, I'm willing to give it a shot. He agreed, and we began with the Brachistochrone problem and Euler-Lagrange theorems. Sheldon teased me when I got stumped, but then said he'd grade on a curve. I started singing when I realized he wasn't a good teacher, and even made a spitball to shoot at him. Accidentally hit him in the mouth with it.\nI argued with Sheldon about dropping his class and violating the sanctity of his mouth. We quizzed each other on technicalities; I gave him a hard time, but he managed to keep up.\nLeonard, Raj, Sheldon, and I were hanging out at the apartment, playing a trivia game. We answered some tough questions and felt pretty smart. We also joked about why girls didn't like us in high school. Good times.\nI was practicing throwing a baseball because I'm going to throw out the first pitch at an Angels game as an astronaut. Raj was heckling me and Sheldon joined in, reminding me of my lack of athletic ability. Penny came out and congratulated me, calling me the athlete of the group. Sheldon bragged about his Quidditch team and Penny made a joke about it. Eventually, I threw the ball while Raj continued to heckle me.\nRaj asked if I ever played baseball as a kid, but I threw my arm out the day of tryouts because of my dad's Playboy collection. Bernadette tested our distance from home plate to the pitcher mound, and I couldn't believe it when we finally reached the sixty feet mark.\nBernadette gave me some terrible advice for throwing a ball at the gym. Raj was there trying to encourage me, but Bernadette just kept telling me to throw the ball without any helpful tips.",

Howard complained that Stuart got more HBOs than he did growing up. Later, Raj introduced Emily, a dermatology resident, to everyone. Sheldon awkwardly joked about his buttock freckles, and Penny offered to practice her sales pitch on Emily. I couldn't help but feel annoyed at how quickly Howard's mom was accommodating Stuart's living situation, even though Howard didn't have it as good growing up.\nI remember discussing Emily with Penny and Bernadette in Penny's apartment. Penny felt like Emily didn't like her, but Bernadette reassured her. Penny also mentioned a past experience with a teacher who had a crush on her. I asked if anyone had ever told Penny they hated her to her face, but didn't say it myself because of Penny's nice cheekbones.\nI remember Penny talking about her feud with Emily, and how she didn't understand why Emily was so upset. Bernadette tried to cheer Penny up, but Amy suggested a plan to make Emily like her. Penny didn't agree with the plan, and they all had a laugh about it.\nSheldon asked for my opinion on investing in Stuart's comic book store, and warned me to be enthusiastically supportive. I questioned whether it was a wise use of his intellectual and financial resources, but he didn't agree. He then mentioned something about a van.\nPenny invited us for a girls' trip to Vegas instead of going to brunch. Bernadette and I were all in, and we checked hotels and underpants. Leonard seemed fine with it.\nPenny suggested watching a cover band, Fairly Manilow, but didn't want to dance until vomiting. She had to leave early due to work, so Bernadette and I decided not to see the band.\nI remember convincing Bernadette to pretend to be the ones who pooped at a party, but we accidentally revealed the truth to the housekeeping lady. We then talked about our fun night and plans to see Australian male strippers, but Penny had to study. So, we decided to help her study and even joked about leaving her notes at the strip club.\nAt the Vegas strip club, Bernadette and Penny were enjoying the atmosphere while watching the dancers. Bernadette commented on the experience being better than a hotel room, and they complimented the body of one of the dancers. I chimed in with a joke about anatomy class.",

Sheldon is at the train station and Leonard wants to go get him. It's sweet how Leonard looks out for Sheldon, and it's not just because of their friendship.\nLeonard tracked Sheldon's phone at the train station. Sheldon wanted to leave and go off on his own, but Leonard and I tried to convince him to come home. Eventually, we agreed to let him go and wished him luck.\nAmy said Sheldon is doing okay and they will talk to each other tomorrow. Leonard and Penny agreed that it's for the best that Sheldon took a sabbatical. Amy asked Leonard why he let Sheldon go.\nLeonard and I were in his apartment, he declined my offer to do yoga with me, and then he received a call from Sheldon who got robbed in Kingman, Arizona. Leonard agreed to go pick him up and bring his stuff. I couldn't go with him because of a job interview. Leonard asked me if he should invite Amy to come with him. I went to Howard and Bernadette's apartment and talked to Bernadette about my nervousness for a pharmaceutical sales job interview. She boosted my confidence and convinced me to go. Bernadette suggested it was similar to being a waitress and the main role would be selling their antidepressants. I felt unprepared but Bernadette reminded me she wouldn't have recommended me if she didn't think I could handle it. Dan asked me why I thought I'd be a good pharmaceutical sales rep. I told him I'm a people person and my previous job as a waitress prepared me for sales. Dan mentioned having an insulin pump and I said \"people\" way too many times. I went to a pharmaceutical company office for an interview, but I didn't do well. Dan asked me how to convince physicians to switch to their drug. I made a joke about washing cars in a bikini and apologized for wasting his time. I asked him not to tell Bernadette about my bad interview because I'm scared of her. Surprisingly, Dan was scared of Bernadette too and said that she's a bully. He shared an experience where he had to tell her that they were cutting the funding for a drug she was developing but he couldn't do it. We both decided not to tell Bernadette about our conversation. So, Sheldon comes back from a trip feeling down, but Amy and Leonard encourage him that he accomplished something. Sheldon compares himself to Gandalf the Grey and feels renewed after his experience. When Penny enters with a new hairstyle, Sheldon can't handle the change and leaves abruptly. So, Sheldon showed us pictures from his trip where he travelled the country by train and never left any station. He even took Imodium to avoid using the train bathroom, but it didn't last long after Des Moines. Leonard made a pun about silver linings when Sheldon's phone got stolen, but luckily, his photos were backed up to the Cloud.\nWe were all discussing the idea of creating super soldiers by impregnating women with animals. Sheldon suggested koalas would be the best choice, while Leonard thought hippos would make badass soldiers. Then, the conversation shifted to my new job in pharmaceutical sales, and Bernadette wanted me to start on the material before starting next week. There was some awkwardness, and Sheldon sensed it. Finally, Leonard brought up being a teacher's pet.\nAmy was in the lab stimulating the pleasure cells of a starfish. We were supposed to go to lunch, but she needed to turn off the stimulation before leaving. Bernadette wasn't coming with us because she's been bugging me since she helped me get my job. Amy mentioned that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends, and asked \"what is that little skank's problem?\" about Bernadette.\nAmy asked me to hang out tonight and go to Color Me Mine, but I declined to study the materials Bernadette gave me for work.

I expressed my frustration with how much my mom talks to Sheldon instead of me. She also said I should work on wanting her approval.\nI talked to Sheldon about our living arrangements now that Penny and I are engaged. He offered to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period, but we were thinking more of us living together without him.

I explained that I was on a journey because of various reasons and my possessions were stolen while I slept. I was wearing no trousers because I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle. I also mentioned my profession as a world-renowned physicist and explained the difference between a boson and a fermion. My legs were cold and nobody helped me. Leonard picked me up from the police station in Arizona after my things were stolen. I asked him to bring my toothbrush, mail, and a good comeback for being called chicken legs. He also considered bringing Amy with him. I went to Kingman Police Station and spoke to Officer Hernandez about my stolen belongings. I suggested using Sherlock Holmes' method of elimination, but Hernandez hadn't tried that. Asked about stolen items at the Kingman police station to Hernandez. Mentioned Sherlock Holmes and Cool Ranch Doritos to Leonard. Amy arrived, asks if I'm okay and why she came. Told her shotgun in a whisper.

Amy said it's okay that I'm not perfect, but then I wanted to break up with her because she hurt my feelings. I recently went on a trip and did not feel better after coming back. Leonard and Amy tried to convince me that it was still an accomplishment, and that the trip was good for me. I compared myself to Gandalf the Grey and ultimately feel renewed and ready to face any changes. When I saw Penny back, I noticed that she had changed her hair and couldn't handle it, so I left. I showed my trip photos to Penny and Leonard, and shared my experience of traveling across the country without ever leaving the train station. I almost died in a fire in Des Moines but managed to survive. Also, my photos were backed up in the Cloud after my phone got stolen.\nAs Sheldon, I had a conversation with Howard, Raj, Amy, Leonard, Penny, and Bernadette about the possibility of creating interspecies supersoldiers. We discussed using gorillas, hippos, owls, and koalas, but ultimately settled on cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. The conversation then shifted to Penny's new job in pharmaceutical sales, and there was some perceived awkwardness between her and Bernadette about reviewing the materials. Leonard made a quip about being a teacher's pet, which reminded us of a time when Ms. McDonald forgot a quiz.\nI had an awful meeting with human resources. They made me a junior professor and required me to teach a class. Leonard thinks the kids will love me because I enjoy telling people they're wrong and giving grades. Howard thinks I love the sound of my own voice. Raj asked why it's bad that I have to teach.\nLeonard, Howard, and Raj came to check on my class, but no one signed up because apparently I have a reputation for being obnoxious. Howard wanted to take my class, but I refused since it's a graduate-level physics class, and I don't think he'd understand a single thing I was talking about.\n\"Amy interrupted me while I was trying to prepare my lesson plan, and started talking about her conversation with Bernadette and Penny. I told her to stop and focus. She then jokingly threatened me about dating the popular girl.\"\nI was up late working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz. Leonard questioned why I try so hard to prove that I'm smarter than him. He thinks it's because I'm scared of someone being smarter than me. I asked him how I can use Howard's peanut allergy against him.\nHoward expressed concern that I may be trying to belittle him by making our class unnecessarily hard. I assured him that we both can benefit from this experience and we proceeded with the class. However, Howard's behavior became disruptive, starting with his singing and culminating in shooting a spitball at me.\nI was at Amy's lab and overheard a conversation between Amy and Penny, where Amy invited Penny to Color Me Mine but Penny declined to study for work. Then Bernadette showed up and said she couldn't come to Color Me Mine because she had promised to help Penny study. I briefly spoke to Amy before leaving.\nLeonard assured me that my uvula is not infected, but it doesn't feel innocent anymore. Howard violated the sanctity of my mouth and I reported him to human resources. Howard dropped my class, but I knew he wasn't smart enough for it anyway. He challenged me on engineering, but I proved him wrong. Thankfully, I remembered Poiseuille's law.\nI asked a question about Easter while playing a trivia game with Leonard, Raj, and Howard. We answered questions about galactic years and Archimedean solids. Then Howard asked a question for a Cadbury Creme Egg, and we all answered correctly. We celebrated our success but also pondered why we weren't popular in high school.\nHoward practiced throwing a baseball for a pitch with Leonard and Raj heckling him while Penny joined in.

I'm making up for missed date nights by inviting Penny on a double date, but it seems a double date doesn't count as two dates, so I don't really care if she comes or not.\nAt Penny's apartment, we discussed committee meeting proposals which ultimately led to us choosing to go to a pub due to the availability of Yorkshire pudding. Despite criticisms, Amy and I continue to have the superior relationship in our circle. A dispute arose between Leonard and Penny regarding her preferred wine.\nLeonard questioned why our relationship is wonderful and theirs is not. I said we enjoy spending time together, even if it's parallel play. Penny asked why Leonard cared. Leonard criticized our relationship agreement, but I defended it with a reference to the U.S. Constitution. Amy made a joking remark.",

They joked around and then, out of nowhere, Penny and Leonard announced their engagement. We all congratulated them and I made a joke about thinking my own news about being with Emily was going to be the big news.\nIn the cafeteria, I was hungry and Howard suggested that it might be because I had s*x. Leonard and Sheldon then had a conversation about academic struggles and Howard joked about job opportunities in home care. I mentioned my coping mechanism for feeling low.\nI was at the comic book store with Howard and Stuart. Howard accused Stuart of attempting to get insurance money. Stuart then asked if he could stay at my place for a few days. However, I had already made plans with Emily. Howard then offered Stuart a job that involved humiliation and degradation. Stuart asked what the catch was.\nI thanked Howard for the lift and cracked a joke about removing the tints on my car windows. He didn't get it, saying no one cared about me. We playfully teased each other until Howard mentioned checking on his mom. Stuart had moved out now that her cast was off, which made things awkward. We joked about it, but Howard seemed unsure. Suddenly, Stuart showed up at Mrs. Wolowitz's place and revealed he and Debbie decided to stay together. Mrs. Wolowitz called for Stuart, surprising Howard. I encouraged him to call his mom more often, agreeing that it's weird for someone in their thirties to live with their mother. Howard questioned me about his mom, and to his surprise, I gave him my blessing. Mrs. Wolowitz and Stuart pranked us, and before we parted, I reminded Howard to leave a message.",

Amy asked Leonard why he let Sheldon go.\nLeonard and I were in his apartment, he declined my offer to do yoga with me, and then he received a call from Sheldon who got robbed in Kingman, Arizona. Leonard agreed to go pick him up and bring his stuff. I couldn't go with him because of a job interview. Leonard asked me if he should invite Amy to come with him. I went to Howard and Bernadette's apartment and talked to Bernadette about my nervousness for a pharmaceutical sales job interview. She boosted my confidence and convinced me to go. Bernadette suggested it was similar to being a waitress and the main role would be selling their antidepressants. I felt unprepared but Bernadette reminded me she wouldn't have recommended me if she didn't think I could handle it. Dan asked me why I thought I'd be a good pharmaceutical sales rep. I told him I'm a people person and my previous job as a waitress prepared me for sales. Dan mentioned having an insulin pump and I said \"people\" way too many times. I went to a pharmaceutical company office for an interview, but I didn't do well. Dan asked me how to convince physicians to switch to their drug. I made a joke about washing cars in a bikini and apologized for wasting his time. I asked him not to tell Bernadette about my bad interview because I'm scared of her. Surprisingly, Dan was scared of Bernadette too and said that she's a bully. He shared an experience where he had to tell her that they were cutting the funding for a drug she was developing but he couldn't do it. We both decided not to tell Bernadette about our conversation. So, Sheldon comes back from a trip feeling down, but Amy and Leonard encourage him that he accomplished something. Sheldon compares himself to Gandalf the Grey and feels renewed after his experience. When Penny enters with a new hairstyle, Sheldon can't handle the change and leaves abruptly. So, Sheldon showed us pictures from his trip where he travelled the country by train and never left any station. He even took Imodium to avoid using the train bathroom, but it didn't last long after Des Moines. Leonard made a pun about silver linings when Sheldon's phone got stolen, but luckily, his photos were backed up to the Cloud.\nWe were all discussing the idea of creating super soldiers by impregnating women with animals. Sheldon suggested koalas would be the best choice, while Leonard thought hippos would make badass soldiers. Then, the conversation shifted to my new job in pharmaceutical sales, and Bernadette wanted me to start on the material before starting next week. There was some awkwardness, and Sheldon sensed it. Finally, Leonard brought up being a teacher's pet.\nAmy was in the lab stimulating the pleasure cells of a starfish. We were supposed to go to lunch, but she needed to turn off the stimulation before leaving. Bernadette wasn't coming with us because she's been bugging me since she helped me get my job. Amy mentioned that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends, and asked \"what is that little skank's problem?\" about Bernadette.\nAmy asked me to hang out tonight and go to Color Me Mine, but I declined to study the materials Bernadette gave me for work. Amy teased me about Bernadette riding me like a bicycle, but I think she just wants to help me succeed. Bernadette apologized for being too hard on me and we're good now. Sheldon was too busy with a spitball to talk.\nBernadette and I were discussing potential side effects of an erectile dysfunction drug. I mentioned that headaches, dizziness, and nausea could occur, to which she agreed. I made a joke about those same symptoms happening if an elderly man with an erection climbed on top of you. Bernadette offered to stop but I was okay to continue. We decided to go for a drink and call Amy to join us. Amy greeted us when we called her.\nHoward was practicing throwing a ball for a baseball game. Raj heckled him and Sheldon made fun of him for not being picked for a team. Penny came and congratulated Howard for being chosen to throw the first pitch for the Angels. Sheldon bragged about being a part of a Quidditch team. Raj continued to heckle Howard and they eventually stopped playing.\nSheldon talked about his lecture and the Cornish game hen dish. Amy made a sarcastic comment about their unhappy waiter. Sheldon and Amy planned a movie night and invited Penny for a double date, but Sheldon didn't care if she came or not.\nSheldon and Amy wanted to have a picnic in a park, but Sheldon shot down the proposal. Amy suggested a pub which Sheldon agreed to after seeing Yorkshire pudding on the menu. Leonard made a joke about their relationship. Sheldon claimed that his and Amy's relationship was the best in the group. Leonard and Penny were at the bottom of the \"relationship rank\". We had a small argument with a joke about wine.\nSo, Leonard and Sheldon were arguing about their relationships and Sheldon brought up the U.S. Constitution.

Leonard wanted to take the quiz, but Penny thought it was stupid. Amy even joked that our outing counted as two dates.\nI suggested taking on Koothrappali and his dog after winning a comparison with Penny and Amy's relationships. Leonard emphasized that being different doesn't mean we're a bad couple and Penny agreed to take the test, despite Leonard's apprehension.

Howard expressed his dislike of the current store and missing Stuart's old store. Leonard joked about Howard's love for HBOs. Raj brought up the fact that Stuart might not be able to reopen because he didn't get enough money from the insurance company. I shared my frustrations with insurance companies. Leonard suggested that we put up the rest of the money to help Stuart reopen and become owners of a comic book store.

Raj disagreed and said he wouldn't drop his friends, but joked about the consequences of a potential breakup.\nMet Raj's girlfriend Emily, she's a dermatology resident. Bernadette suggested that Penny practice her pharmaceutical sales pitch on Emily. I asked Emily to look at some odd freckles on my buttocks, to which she reluctantly agreed. Amy made a joke about our relationship compared to Raj's.\nI was at Capital Comics with my friends and we were discussing Stuart's place. Howard expressed his dislike of the current store and missing Stuart's old store. Leonard joked about Howard's love for HBOs. Raj brought up the fact that Stuart might not be able to reopen because he didn't get enough money from the insurance company. I shared my frustrations with insurance companies. Leonard suggested that we put up the rest of the money to help Stuart reopen and become owners of a comic book store. We joked about competing with the current store and I suggested a humorous business plan.\nIn a discussion with Leonard, Howard, and Raj, we talked about different ways to stand out in competition. We came up with a plan to pick kids up from parks and schools in a van. Later, Raj mentioned to Penny that we hooked up, and I made a comment on losing friends.\nHoward and I discussed opening our own comic book store, where we could have fun interactions with customers. Leonard brought up Penny's infamous list and I joked about her still wading through it. We also discussed the importance of honesty and how it can affect relationships.\nI asked Amy for her opinion on investing in Stuart's comic book store, stressing the importance of enthusiastic support. Amy expressed concern, but ultimately praised the idea. I then mentioned our van.\nI remember discussing our disappointment about not having our own comic book store with Raj, Leonard, and Howard. We were all looking forward to having a place where we could sit, read comics and enjoy snacks in peace. But unfortunately, it turned out to be too good to be true, and we all sighed in disappointment.\nI remember being in the cafeteria with Raj, Leonard, and Howard. Raj brought up the idea of converting footsteps to electromagnetic energy. Leonard mentioned that they had that idea years ago, but it never went anywhere. I pointed out that Leonard became distracted by Penny and listed his recent accomplishments. We then discussed having a science retreat to brainstorm ideas, but I objected to going to a cabin, hotel, or lake house due to horror movies.\nLeonard, Howard, Raj, and I were in the apartment discussing ideas, and we got sidetracked when Howard made a joke about Raj's girlfriend. We then started brainstorming ideas and ended up talking about inventions that can be used for sex until we decided to focus on something new. We talked about how science fiction can inspire real-life inventions, and we discussed the possibility of creating the hoverboard from \"Back to the Future II.\" Raj volunteered to make popcorn for us while we watched the movie.\nI remember Howard, Leonard, and Raj discussing the time travel paradox and the movie Hot Tub Time Machine. We talked about the correct tense for events affected by time travel and the impact on the timeline. We also went on a tangent about Biff's name and sausage wrapped Pillsbury dough. All while attempting to focus without the girls present.\nI proposed using operant conditioning techniques to stay on track during our work. We discussed punishment options, including snap bands and even the medieval scold's bridle. I then suggested checking Amazon for it.",
        "summ_memory": "I have several memories with my friends, including Howard throwing out the first pitch at Angels Stadium using a Mars Rover prototype and discussing opening a comic book store. We talked about science and inventions, sex, time travel paradox, and punishment techniques for focus during work. In one conversation, I suggested going to Disneyland to play hide and seek on Tom Sawyer's Island, while in another, we talked about a research team creating a dinosaur chicken. Raj's girlfriend Emily and Penny's pharmaceutical sales pitch also came up. We also discussed investing in Stuart's comic book store and brainstormed ideas for a science retreat."

Amy made a sarcastic comment about Sheldon's relationship with Penny.\nI talked to Bernadette and Amy about Emily, but I got the sense that she didn't like me. Bernadette said I was worrying for no reason and brought up my high school P.E. teacher, who liked me a little too much. Amy asked if anyone has ever said they hated me to my face, but didn't actually say it.\nI remember that we were discussing ways to get more kids into the comic book store, and someone suggested using a van to pick them up. Then Raj mentioned something about telling everyone we hooked up, which I didn't appreciate, and Sheldon made a joke about losing friends.\nAmy and Bernadette were trying to cheer me up about a girl who doesn't like me. Amy suggested pretending to be her friend until she likes me, but I said it wouldn't work. Bernadette said I should use my sales training to sell myself, but I thought it was stupid. We all joked around and reminisced about how Amy and I didn't used to be friends.\nLeonard asked if it's okay to invest in Stuart\u2019s comic book store because it's a big deal financially and we're engaged. I asked if he considers credit card debt a big deal financially.\nRaj and Emily visited my apartment, where Emily apologized for being rude. Raj expressed his desire for all of us to get along, but I assured them that what happened between Raj and me was in the past. Emily and I complimented each other's looks, and Raj clumsily joked about his single life.\nHad a great night with Raj and Emily, we're planning to have a dinner with Leonard. Before leaving, we said goodnight and then Emily and I said, \"I hate her\" simultaneously.\nLeonard asked if they could have a science retreat this weekend instead of brunch on Sunday. I suggested going to Vegas instead and everyone agreed to check flights and hotels. Leonard seemed okay with the plan. Amy got really excited and said something about peeing. Bernadette and I are planning a girls' weekend in Vegas.\nAmy suggested going to a cover band in the lounge, but I wasn't interested until she said they played Barry Manilow and were called Fairly Manilow. We then joked about getting margaritas and dancing until we vomited, but my boss called and moved up my field ride, so I had to study instead. Amy and Bernadette decided not to go see Fairly Manilow without me.\nI remember the three of us in the hotel room, Bernadette admitting to being the one who pooped at a party, and then offering to go to a club to see Australian male strippers. I had to decline because I still needed to study, and they offered to help me study so I can finish quicker.\nAt the Vegas strip club, Bernadette and I were cheering while the music was blaring. We admired a dancer's body, and Amy made a funny remark about corpses in her anatomy class.",

Sheldon initially opposed but changed his mind after finding out they serve Yorkshire pudding. Sheldon and Amy have a superior relationship to the rest of us. There is no official ranking, but if there was, we wouldn't be at the bottom. Penny and I bicker about what she drinks.\nThis conversation was about Sheldon comparing his relationship with Amy to mine with someone else. He claimed they have a strong relationship because they enjoy spending time together, even if they're doing different things. We argued about it, with Penny wondering why we care so much. Sheldon defended his views, referring to the U.S. Constitution as a basis for a relationship agreement. Amy eventually jokes about a fire starting in her flag underwear.\nI was at the pub with Amy, Penny, and Sheldon. Sheldon was being Sheldon, quantifying everything. He refused to share his food with Amy because it had avocado. Penny didn't want to take the Relationship Closeness Inventory, but Sheldon and Amy got an 8.2 out of 10. Penny left to get another drink.\nLeonard asked Penny if she was mad at him at the pub. She said no but expressed her worry that they are engaged and have nothing in common. Leonard admitted that he is also scared about that. They both agreed that they are afraid their marriage will be a disaster. They also both think that Leonard is not funny.\nWe were at the pub and Penny and Amy apologized for comparing relationships. Sheldon suggested we take a test to see if we were a good couple. I didn't want to, but Penny insisted. I said I didn't care about our score, I just wanted to marry her. Amy was happy with what I said and Sheldon claimed we got an eight-point-two.\nI remember being at Angels Stadium with Raj, Penny, Sheldon, Amy, and Bernadette.

Sheldon wanted to leave to go to Disneyland but was promised cotton candy and a bobblehead if he stayed.\nI was chatting with Sheldon, Howard and Raj about the possibility of transgenic chicken dinosaurs. Sheldon made a joke about it, and then brought up a study about losing friends when entering into a new relationship.

Howard suggested that we get a van and pick kids up to bring them to the store. Penny got upset when Raj told Emily they hooked up, even though they just fooled around while drunk. Sheldon joked about losing friends, but Raj said he would never lose Sheldon as a friend.\nSheldon and Howard were talking about opening a comic book store. Sheldon mentioned having fun interactions with customers. Leonard brought up a conversation he had with Penny about leaving people off her list.

Howard thinks I love the sound of my own voice. Raj asked why it's bad that I have to teach.\nLeonard, Howard, and Raj came to check on my class, but no one signed up because apparently I have a reputation for being obnoxious. Howard wanted to take my class, but I refused since it's a graduate-level physics class, and I don't think he'd understand a single thing I was talking about.\n\"Amy interrupted me while I was trying to prepare my lesson plan, and started talking about her conversation with Bernadette and Penny. I told her to stop and focus. She then jokingly threatened me about dating the popular girl.\"\nI was up late working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz. Leonard questioned why I try so hard to prove that I'm smarter than him. He thinks it's because I'm scared of someone being smarter than me. I asked him how I can use Howard's peanut allergy against him.\nHoward expressed concern that I may be trying to belittle him by making our class unnecessarily hard. I assured him that we both can benefit from this experience and we proceeded with the class. However, Howard's behavior became disruptive, starting with his singing and culminating in shooting a spitball at me.\nI was at Amy's lab and overheard a conversation between Amy and Penny, where Amy invited Penny to Color Me Mine but Penny declined to study for work. Then Bernadette showed up and said she couldn't come to Color Me Mine because she had promised to help Penny study. I briefly spoke to Amy before leaving.",

We both acknowledged that time would pass quickly. I went to the Kingman Police Station to see Sheldon, my boyfriend. He seemed alright, but mentioned something about using Cool Ranch Doritos instead of cocaine. Leonard was there too. When I asked him why I came, he said he had something to tell me but whispered it instead; he said \"shotgun.\" Sheldon and Leonard were discussing ketchup brands at different train stations. Sheldon then brought up calling Leonard for help and not saying goodbye to Amy. Amy was upset about this and asked for privacy to talk to Sheldon. Sheldon then told Leonard about wanting to have coitus with Amy and called himself a failure for not being able to do something on his own. Amy reassured him that it's okay and that he doesn't need to be perfect. Sheldon then said he wants to break up with her. Sheldon is feeling down about his trip but Leonard reminds him that he accomplished something. Amy chimes in and says that the mishaps make it an adventure. Sheldon compares himself to Gandalf and claims to have returned stronger. Penny shows up with a new hairstyle and Sheldon can't handle the change.\nSo, we were having a conversation about supersoldiers and which animal would be best for the program. Then, we moved on to Penny starting her new job in pharmaceutical sales and Bernadette giving her some advice. Sheldon sensed some awkwardness, but Leonard made a joke about being a teacher's pet.\nI was stimulating the pleasure cells of a starfish before going to lunch with Penny. We talked about Bernadette and how she's been bugging Penny since helping her get the job. I mentioned that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between friends.\nI told Sheldon about a funny situation with Penny and Bernadette after drinks.

However, he shut me down because he was busy trying to intellectually emasculate Howard.\nI called Penny to suggest going to Color Me Mine and sneaking in some Pinot, but she declined to study with Bernadette. Later, Bernadette and I talked about their earlier disagreement, and Sheldon was too busy to talk.\nPenny and Bernadette discussed the side effects of an erectile dysfunction drug. Penny made a joke about the side effects of sleeping with an older man. They decided to go out for a drink and invited me, Amy, to join.\nSheldon asked if I enjoyed his lecture and I replied, \"No, and neither did our waiter.\" We talked about Cornish game hen and then planned a movie night which turned into a double date with Sheldon inviting Penny.\nSheldon, Leonard, Penny, and I had a conversation about going out. Sheldon initially didn't want to go to a pub, but I suggested it and it passed as a proposal. Sheldon likes the pub because they serve Yorkshire pudding, even though he doesn't like it. He thinks he and I have a superior relationship compared to the others in our circle, which upset Leonard and Penny. They started arguing, and I made a joke about Penny talking to her drink instead of them.",

Something feels weird about it but I'm not sure why.\nI gave Raj a lift to work while his car windows were being untinted. We briefly discussed my mom's care and her previous caretaker, Stuart, who had become a little too chummy with her. Raj made some inappropriate jokes, but I quickly shut them down with my love for my mother. I went to see my mom at her house with Raj and found Stuart there. He said he didn't move out as he and his girlfriend like having him there. My mom then called out for her glasses and Stuart went to help her. Raj suggested I call my mom more often. I was in my car with Raj and we were talking about my living situation with my mother. Raj thought it was weird, but justified it because my mother was lonely and the guy needed a place to stay. I asked if he would be okay if I slept with his mom, but he gave me his blessing. In the end, I decided to call my mother and be honest with her. Stuart's voicemail answered and we left a message. Bernadette told me that Penny got a job because the interviewer loves her. Stuart came over and asked to stay at my mom's but I think it's weird that he's living there rent-free. We argued, but it ended with Stuart storming out and me making a sarcastic remark.\nSo, Sheldon brought up Stalin trying to make supersoldiers with gorillas, and we all had some interesting animal suggestions. Then, Bernardette was trying to push Penny to study for her new job, but Penny wasn't having it. Oh, and there was some awkwardness.\nRaj was trying to come up with a cute couple's nickname, while Sheldon didn't enjoy being made to teach a class, despite Leonard pointing out its advantages.\nI remember trying to convince Sheldon that I was smart enough to take his graduate-level physics class, but he kept throwing difficult questions at me. Raj was there with cookies and Leonard and Howard were watching.\nSheldon and I were in a classroom, about to start a class. I told him that if he intends to make this class difficult, I'm out. If not, I'm willing to give it a shot. He agreed, and we began with the Brachistochrone problem and Euler-Lagrange theorems. Sheldon teased me when I got stumped, but then said he'd grade on a curve. I started singing when I realized he wasn't a good teacher, and even made a spitball to shoot at him. Accidentally hit him in the mouth with it.\nI argued with Sheldon about dropping his class and violating the sanctity of his mouth. We quizzed each other on technicalities; I gave him a hard time, but he managed to keep up.\nLeonard, Raj, Sheldon, and I were hanging out at the apartment, playing a trivia game. We answered some tough questions and felt pretty smart. We also joked about why girls didn't like us in high school. Good times.\nI was practicing throwing a baseball because I'm going to throw out the first pitch at an Angels game as an astronaut. Raj was heckling me and Sheldon joined in, reminding me of my lack of athletic ability. Penny came out and congratulated me, calling me the athlete of the group. Sheldon bragged about his Quidditch team and Penny made a joke about it. Eventually, I threw the ball while Raj continued to heckle me.\nRaj asked if I ever played baseball as a kid, but I threw my arm out the day of tryouts because of my dad's Playboy collection. Bernadette tested our distance from home plate to the pitcher mound, and I couldn't believe it when we finally reached the sixty feet mark.",

I visited Howard\u2019s mom's house with Howard, and Stuart surprised us by still living there with his girlfriend Debbie.

Leonard expressed that he wants to do scary things with Penny and an eight-point-two score was achieved.\nSo, we were at Angels Stadium to watch Howard throw the first pitch, and Sheldon was not interested in the game. Amy offered to buy him cotton candy and a bobblehead to stay. Howard ended up pitching with a Mars Rover prototype, and it didn't go as planned. Sheldon wanted to leave and go to Disneyland, but we ended up waiting for the pitch to end.\nI asked Howard about Stuart and his living arrangements, but he didn't want to talk about it. Bernadette mentioned that Stuart will be living with Howard's mom. Howard complained that Stuart got more HBOs than he did growing up. Later, Raj introduced Emily, a dermatology resident, to everyone. Sheldon awkwardly joked about his buttock freckles, and Penny offered to practice her sales pitch on Emily. I couldn't help but feel annoyed at how quickly Howard's mom was accommodating Stuart's living situation, even though Howard didn't have it as good growing up.\nI remember discussing Emily with Penny and Bernadette in Penny's apartment. Penny felt like Emily didn't like her, but Bernadette reassured her. Penny also mentioned a past experience with a teacher who had a crush on her. I asked if anyone had ever told Penny they hated her to her face, but didn't say it myself because of Penny's nice cheekbones.\nI remember Penny talking about her feud with Emily, and how she didn't understand why Emily was so upset. Bernadette tried to cheer Penny up, but Amy suggested a plan to make Emily like her. Penny didn't agree with the plan, and they all had a laugh about it.\nSheldon asked for my opinion on investing in Stuart's comic book store, and warned me to be enthusiastically supportive. I questioned whether it was a wise use of his intellectual and financial resources, but he didn't agree. He then mentioned something about a van.\nPenny invited us for a girls' trip to Vegas instead of going to brunch. Bernadette and I were all in, and we checked hotels and underpants. Leonard seemed fine with it.\nPenny suggested watching a cover band, Fairly Manilow, but didn't want to dance until vomiting. She had to leave early due to work, so Bernadette and I decided not to see the band.",

Leonard jokes about Howard's mom and her confusion over Game of Thrones. Raj mentions Stuart's financial troubles and Sheldon rants about insurance companies.

Howard made a joke about my girlfriend being in a pit and we discussed the Facebook movie. Then we looked at old ideas and talked about robot girlfriends and prostitutes. Sheldon mentioned how science fiction has inspired real-life inventions and we decided to focus on creating something from Back to the Future II.

Then Bernadette measured a distance of sixty feet, six inches for the pitcher's mound in Major League Baseball, and Howard was surprised that it was that far.\nAt the gym, Howard struggled to learn how to throw a ball, Bernadette wasn't much help, and Raj encouraged him to keep trying.\nAt the gym, Howard almost had an accident, but thankfully avoided it. Bernadette asked if anyone thinks he's getting better, to which I replied \"Yup\". She also confirmed that it was too late for him to cancel.\nI remember being at Angels Stadium with Penny, Leonard, Sheldon, Amy, and Bernadette. We were there to see Howard throw the first pitch, but he surprised us by throwing a prototype of the Mars Rover instead. The crowd booed, and Sheldon suggested we go to Disneyland while we waited for the rover to reach home plate.\nLeonard, Sheldon, Howard and I were discussing a research team that's trying to transgenically manipulate chicken DNA to create a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich. Sheldon quoted a study from Oxford University about losing friends when someone takes on a new romantic partner. Leonard and Howard teased Sheldon about not reading social science. We confirmed plans for tomorrow night and talked about my girlfriend. Leonard asked if I would drop my friends if my girlfriend didn't like them, and I joked that they would only get a Christmas card for a couple of years.\nI walked into Howard's apartment and met Emily, a dermatology resident. Sheldon made an awkward comment about her hospital's emergency room. Bernadette suggested Penny could practice being a pharmaceutical sales rep on Emily. Then, Sheldon asked Emily to look at his odd freckles and Amy made a sarcastic remark.\nSheldon complains about the current comic book store, and Howard agrees, wishing Stuart would reopen. Leonard jokes about Howard's mom and her confusion over Game of Thrones. Raj mentions Stuart's financial troubles and Sheldon rants about insurance companies. Leonard suggests they invest in Stuart's store and become owners. The group laughs and discusses creating a business plan to compete with the current store. Sheldon suggests a questionable plan, but Leonard says it's not that bad.\nSheldon, Leonard, Howard, and I were discussing ways to boost our comic book store's sales. We came up with the idea of using a van to pick up kids from different places. Later, I ended up telling Penny about my hookup with Emily, which she didn't appreciate. Sheldon made a joke about losing friends, and I ended up telling him that he's not the next one to lose.\nI remember visiting Penny's apartment where Emily apologized for being rude in the past, and Penny and I cleared up our old issues. We all sat down and talked it out, complimenting each other's beauty, and I ended up jokingly mentioning my struggles in my love life.",

Despite criticisms, Amy and I continue to have the superior relationship in our circle. A dispute arose between Leonard and Penny regarding her preferred wine.\nLeonard questioned why our relationship is wonderful and theirs is not. I said we enjoy spending time together, even if it's parallel play. Penny asked why Leonard cared. Leonard criticized our relationship agreement, but I defended it with a reference to the U.S. Constitution. Amy made a joking remark.\nAt the pub, we discussed relationships and rated them using the Relationship Closeness Inventory. Leonard and Penny scored poorly, while Amy and I scored an impressive 8.2. Leonard wanted to take the quiz, but Penny thought it was stupid. Amy even joked that our outing counted as two dates.\nI suggested taking on Koothrappali and his dog after winning a comparison with Penny and Amy's relationships.

We talked about the correct tense for events affected by time travel and the impact on the timeline. We also went on a tangent about Biff's name and sausage wrapped Pillsbury dough. All while attempting to focus without the girls present.\nI proposed using operant conditioning techniques to stay on track during our work. We discussed punishment options, including snap bands and even the medieval scold's bridle. I then suggested checking Amazon for it.\nWe were discussing quantum coupling, and there was a debate about going off topic. Howard voted for one of our ideas and Leonard owed him one.

He said he didn't move out as he and his girlfriend like having him there. My mom then called out for her glasses and Stuart went to help her. Raj suggested I call my mom more often. I was in my car with Raj and we were talking about my living situation with my mother. Raj thought it was weird, but justified it because my mother was lonely and the guy needed a place to stay.

I went to Howard and Bernadette's apartment and talked to Bernadette about my nervousness for a pharmaceutical sales job interview. She boosted my confidence and convinced me to go. Bernadette suggested it was similar to being a waitress and the main role would be selling their antidepressants. I felt unprepared but Bernadette reminded me she wouldn't have recommended me if she didn't think I could handle it. Dan asked me why I thought I'd be a good pharmaceutical sales rep. I told him I'm a people person and my previous job as a waitress prepared me for sales. Dan mentioned having an insulin pump and I said \"people\" way too many times. I went to a pharmaceutical company office for an interview, but I didn't do well. Dan asked me how to convince physicians to switch to their drug. I made a joke about washing cars in a bikini and apologized for wasting his time. I asked him not to tell Bernadette about my bad interview because I'm scared of her. Surprisingly, Dan was scared of Bernadette too and said that she's a bully.

So, Sheldon showed us pictures from his trip where he travelled the country by train and never left any station. He even took Imodium to avoid using the train bathroom, but it didn't last long after Des Moines. Leonard made a pun about silver linings when Sheldon's phone got stolen, but luckily, his photos were backed up to the Cloud.\nWe were all discussing the idea of creating super soldiers by impregnating women with animals. Sheldon suggested koalas would be the best choice, while Leonard thought hippos would make badass soldiers. Then, the conversation shifted to my new job in pharmaceutical sales, and Bernadette wanted me to start on the material before starting next week. There was some awkwardness, and Sheldon sensed it. Finally, Leonard brought up being a teacher's pet.\nAmy was in the lab stimulating the pleasure cells of a starfish. We were supposed to go to lunch, but she needed to turn off the stimulation before leaving. Bernadette wasn't coming with us because she's been bugging me since she helped me get my job.

After my journey, Leonard and Amy reminded me of my accomplishments. Yet Penny's overpowering hair overwhelmed me, prompting my departure. Unfortunately, I lost my phone. These meticulously recorded details chronicle my travels.\nAs Sheldon, I had a conversation with Howard, Raj, Amy, Leonard, Penny, and Bernadette about the possibility of creating interspecies supersoldiers. We discussed using gorillas, hippos, owls, and koalas, but ultimately settled on cuddly soldiers with big flat noses.

Leonard made a quip about being a teacher's pet, which reminded us of a time when Ms. McDonald forgot a quiz.\nI had an awful meeting with human resources.

I asked him how I can use Howard's peanut allergy against him.\nHoward expressed concern that I may be trying to belittle him by making our class unnecessarily hard. I assured him that we both can benefit from this experience and we proceeded with the class. However, Howard's behavior became disruptive, starting with his singing and culminating in shooting a spitball at me.\nI was at Amy's lab and overheard a conversation between Amy and Penny, where Amy invited Penny to Color Me Mine but Penny declined to study for work. Then Bernadette showed up and said she couldn't come to Color Me Mine because she had promised to help Penny study.

Bernadette suggested that Penny practice her pharmaceutical sales pitch on Emily. I asked Emily to look at some odd freckles on my buttocks, to which she reluctantly agreed. Amy made a joke about our relationship compared to Raj's.\nI was at Capital Comics with my friends and we were discussing Stuart's place. Howard expressed his dislike of the current store and missing Stuart's old store. Leonard joked about Howard's love for HBOs. Raj brought up the fact that Stuart might not be able to reopen because he didn't get enough money from the insurance company. I shared my frustrations with insurance companies. Leonard suggested that we put up the rest of the money to help Stuart reopen and become owners of a comic book store. We joked about competing with the current store and I suggested a humorous business plan.\nIn a discussion with Leonard, Howard, and Raj, we talked about different ways to stand out in competition. We came up with a plan to pick kids up from parks and schools in a van. Later, Raj mentioned to Penny that we hooked up, and I made a comment on losing friends.",

Howard and I were talking about a guy in his thirties who's living with his mother.

I also mentioned my profession as a world-renowned physicist and explained the difference between a boson and a fermion. My legs were cold and nobody helped me. Leonard picked me up from the police station in Arizona after my things were stolen. I asked him to bring my toothbrush, mail, and a good comeback for being called chicken legs.

I suggested using Sherlock Holmes' method of elimination, but Hernandez hadn't tried that. Asked about stolen items at the Kingman police station to Hernandez. Mentioned Sherlock Holmes and Cool Ranch Doritos to Leonard. Amy arrived, asks if I'm okay and why she came. Told her shotgun in a whisper. Leonard asked me about my trip and I told him I went to many cities, but never left the train station. He was confused and asked me why, to which I replied, \"That's where all the cool trains are.\" I also mentioned that I never had a single piece of fruit.

Amy said it's okay that I'm not perfect, but then I wanted to break up with her because she hurt my feelings. I recently went on a trip and did not feel better after coming back. Leonard and Amy tried to convince me that it was still an accomplishment, and that the trip was good for me. I compared myself to Gandalf the Grey and ultimately feel renewed and ready to face any changes. When I saw Penny back, I noticed that she had changed her hair and couldn't handle it, so I left.

Sheldon then brought up calling Leonard for help and not saying goodbye to Amy. Amy was upset about this and asked for privacy to talk to Sheldon. Sheldon then told Leonard about wanting to have coitus with Amy and called himself a failure for not being able to do something on his own. Amy reassured him that it's okay and that he doesn't need to be perfect. Sheldon then said he wants to break up with her. Sheldon is feeling down about his trip but Leonard reminds him that he accomplished something. Amy chimes in and says that the mishaps make it an adventure. Sheldon compares himself to Gandalf and claims to have returned stronger. Penny shows up with a new hairstyle and Sheldon can't handle the change.\nSo, we were having a conversation about supersoldiers and which animal would be best for the program. Then, we moved on to Penny starting her new job in pharmaceutical sales and Bernadette giving her some advice. Sheldon sensed some awkwardness, but Leonard made a joke about being a teacher's pet.\nI was stimulating the pleasure cells of a starfish before going to lunch with Penny. We talked about Bernadette and how she's been bugging Penny since helping her get the job. I mentioned that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between friends.",

I also visited Sheldon and had a conversation about his trip and his relationship with Amy, which ultimately resulted in Sheldon wanting to break up with her.

We talked about tattoos and piercings, and she suggested we show each other ours. Before that, I needed to do some crunches if I were to take my shirt off.\nHey, I walked into the apartment and the gang was discussing Howard's mom, who apparently lost two nurses. They joked around and then, out of nowhere, Penny and Leonard announced their engagement. We all congratulated them and I made a joke about thinking my own news about being with Emily was going to be the big news.\nIn the cafeteria, I was hungry and Howard suggested that it might be because I had s*x. Leonard and Sheldon then had a conversation about academic struggles and Howard joked about job opportunities in home care. I mentioned my coping mechanism for feeling low.\nI was at the comic book store with Howard and Stuart. Howard accused Stuart of attempting to get insurance money. Stuart then asked if he could stay at my place for a few days. However, I had already made plans with Emily. Howard then offered Stuart a job that involved humiliation and degradation.

However, Penny thinks it may be good for him to go on his trip. Ultimately, we let Sheldon go and wished him luck.\nAmy updated Sheldon's condition and we agreed that the sabbatical worked in his favor. Penny thinks this will be for the best. Amy questioned why Sheldon was let go.\nI walked into the apartment and Penny asked about yoga. I declined, needing coffee first. Sheldon called from a police station and needed help. I asked Penny to come, but she had a job interview. I invited Amy and she joined me in the car. Sheldon and I arrived at the police station. Sheldon made a strange comment about Sherlock Holmes and Cool Ranch Doritos. Amy asked why he didn't show more gratitude. Sheldon whispered \"Shotgun.\" Sheldon then listed cities he never visited, content with just being at the train station. We had a heated discussion about condiments. Sheldon confessed his fear of disappointing Amy and suggested breaking up. He expressed regret in the stairwell. Sheldon couldn't handle Penny's new hairstyle and abruptly left. Sheldon showed us pictures from his trip, despite losing his phone. Sheldon shared a harrowing experience in Des Moines.\nDuring a conversation, Sheldon brought up the topic of Joseph Stalin's attempt to create supersoldiers by impregnating women with gorillas. The rest of us discussed what other animals would be suitable for this purpose. Later, when Bernadette asked Penny about her new job in pharmaceutical sales, Sheldon sensed some tension, and we joked about being teacher's pets in school.\nI remember discussing Sheldon's new junior professor job, and how he's not too thrilled about teaching. Raj suggested couple's nicknames for him and Emily, while Howard questioned the reasoning behind the names.\nLeonard and Howard were trying to see how Sheldon's class was going, but it turns out no one signed up. Sheldon brought Fig Newtons and planned to use it in a trick question about who the cookie was named after. Howard wants to take Sheldon's graduate-level physics class but Sheldon doesn't believe Howard is smart enough.\nI had a conversation with Sheldon about his lesson plan for Wolowitz. I challenged him on why he feels the need to prove he's smarter than Wolowitz. I suggested he may have emotional issues related to his need to feel intellectually superior. Sheldon then asked me how he can use Howard's peanut allergy against him.\nSheldon was worried about his uvula having an STD, but I assured him it didn't. Howard and Sheldon had a dispute over a class, and Howard challenged Sheldon's knowledge of engineering. Raj asked some questions, and Sheldon answered with confidence.\nI asked a question about a galactic year and Raj answered correctly, earning cheers from all of us. Then Howard asked a question about an Archimedean solid, and we all answered together. Raj wondered why girls didn't like us in high school, and we concluded that it was because we were awkward and couldn't play sports.\nHoward tries practicing baseball to prepare to throw out the first pitch for the Angels, but struggles at first. Raj heckles him while Sheldon reminds him of his lack of athleticism. Penny congratulates Howard on his opportunity and also pokes fun at Sheldon's Quidditch team. Overall, it's a playful scene among friends.\nSheldon boasted about his lecture to Amy who disliked it. Sheldon defended his dissatisfaction with the Cornish game hen served at a restaurant, later shared with Leonard and Penny. Sheldon and Amy planned to see a movie on a date, which led to Penny and Leonard's surprise. Sheldon tried to make up for missed dates and invited them on a double date. However, after realizing it wouldn't count as two dates, he didn't care if they joined or not.\nSheldon and Amy proposed a picnic in the park, but Sheldon added too many amendments and Amy suggested going to a pub instead. Sheldon initially opposed but changed his mind after finding out they serve Yorkshire pudding. Sheldon and Amy have a superior relationship to the rest of us. There is no official ranking, but if there was, we wouldn't be at the bottom. Penny and I bicker about what she drinks.",
        "summ_memory": "In a series of events, Sheldon considers leaving but ultimately goes on a trip instead. Along the way, our group has various conversations and adventures. Sheldon's relationship with Amy remains strong, and Penny and I playfully argue. Amidst all this, I fondly remember walking on the beach, feeling the warm sand between my toes, and witnessing a beautiful sunset. The serene moment brought a sense of peace and tranquility that stayed with me."

The group laughs and discusses creating a business plan to compete with the current store. Sheldon suggests a questionable plan, but Leonard says it's not that bad.\nSheldon, Leonard, Howard, and I were discussing ways to boost our comic book store's sales. We came up with the idea of using a van to pick up kids from different places. Later, I ended up telling Penny about my hookup with Emily, which she didn't appreciate. Sheldon made a joke about losing friends, and I ended up telling him that he's not the next one to lose.\nI remember visiting Penny's apartment where Emily apologized for being rude in the past, and Penny and I cleared up our old issues. We all sat down and talked it out, complimenting each other's beauty, and I ended up jokingly mentioning my struggles in my love life.\nI just had a good conversation with Penny and Emily at Penny's apartment. Emily suggested that we should all have dinner one night with Leonard, which Penny and I agreed to. As we were saying goodnight, Emily and Penny said in unison, \"I hate her.\"\nWe were talking about our plans to have our own comic book store, but unfortunately it did not work out. Sheldon pointed out that it would have been great to have a peaceful place to read comics. Howard added that he wished we had comfy seats and snacks. We all sighed in disappointment.\nRaj suggests having a science retreat to the gang since they have lost their focus on ideas, but Sheldon is hesitant to go to certain places because of horror movies, such as Cabin in the Woods and Jaws.\nHey, so we were at the apartment and the guys were talking about their inventions. Howard made a joke about my girlfriend being in a pit and we discussed the Facebook movie. Then we looked at old ideas and talked about robot girlfriends and prostitutes. Sheldon mentioned how science fiction has inspired real-life inventions and we decided to focus on creating something from Back to the Future II. We talked about the hoverboard and how it's possible at absolute zero, then decided to watch the movie and I offered to make popcorn.\nSo, we were trying to make sense of the time-travel plot in Back to the Future and Sheldon started questioning the grammar in our conversation. Howard and Leonard tried to clarify things, while I pointed out how weird the name \"Biff\" is. Overall, we didn't really get anywhere and ended up getting sidetracked.\nLeonard suggests using Maglev technology for hover boards. Howard proposes supercooling materials with quantum coupling. Sheldon suggests operant conditioning techniques to stay on topic, and brings up teaching pigeons to play ping-pong with behavior modification. They talk about punishments for straying off topic, including using a rubber band or the scold's bridle. Sheldon looks up the latter on Amazon.\nLeonard suggests arm hair yanking as punishment for getting off topic. Sheldon questions who decides if it's off topic. Howard votes tangent or not. Negative reinforcement is corrected to positive punishment. Bill Murray makes a mistake in Ghostbusters with negative reinforcement. Procrastination in the lab leads to suggestions of watching Ghostbusters. Sheldon insists on watching the whole movie but Leonard disagrees.",

Sheldon and Howard discussed Sheldon's interest in the idea despite his fear of dinosaurs and chickens. Later, Raj joined and they confirmed plans for the following night. Sheldon brought up a study about losing close friends when getting into a romantic relationship, which Leonard disputed based on his relationship with Amy. Raj insisted he wouldn't drop his friends if his girlfriend didn't like them, but joked that they would eventually be dead to him if they didn't remain close.\nAmy asked about Stuart, but I didn't wanna talk about it. Bernadette said he's still living with my mom, and I complained about all the HBOs he got from my mother. Then Raj, Sheldon, Leonard, and Penny came over. We introduced ourselves, and Penny talked to Emily, who's a dermatologist. Sheldon made a weird request to Emily, and Amy made a sarcastic comment about it.\nI remember talking with Sheldon and Leonard about how we miss Stuart's comic book store while listening to loud music.

Sheldon is at the train station and Leonard wants to go get him. It's sweet how Leonard looks out for Sheldon, and it's not just because of their friendship.\nLeonard tracked Sheldon's phone at the train station. Sheldon wanted to leave and go off on his own, but Leonard and I tried to convince him to come home. Eventually, we agreed to let him go and wished him luck.\nAmy said Sheldon is doing okay and they will talk to each other tomorrow. Leonard and Penny agreed that it's for the best that Sheldon took a sabbatical. Amy asked Leonard why he let Sheldon go.\nLeonard and I were in his apartment, he declined my offer to do yoga with me, and then he received a call from Sheldon who got robbed in Kingman, Arizona. Leonard agreed to go pick him up and bring his stuff. I couldn't go with him because of a job interview. Leonard asked me if he should invite Amy to come with him. I went to Howard and Bernadette's apartment and talked to Bernadette about my nervousness for a pharmaceutical sales job interview. She boosted my confidence and convinced me to go. Bernadette suggested it was similar to being a waitress and the main role would be selling their antidepressants. I felt unprepared but Bernadette reminded me she wouldn't have recommended me if she didn't think I could handle it. Dan asked me why I thought I'd be a good pharmaceutical sales rep. I told him I'm a people person and my previous job as a waitress prepared me for sales. Dan mentioned having an insulin pump and I said \"people\" way too many times. I went to a pharmaceutical company office for an interview, but I didn't do well. Dan asked me how to convince physicians to switch to their drug. I made a joke about washing cars in a bikini and apologized for wasting his time. I asked him not to tell Bernadette about my bad interview because I'm scared of her. Surprisingly, Dan was scared of Bernadette too and said that she's a bully. He shared an experience where he had to tell her that they were cutting the funding for a drug she was developing but he couldn't do it. We both decided not to tell Bernadette about our conversation. So, Sheldon comes back from a trip feeling down, but Amy and Leonard encourage him that he accomplished something. Sheldon compares himself to Gandalf the Grey and feels renewed after his experience. When Penny enters with a new hairstyle, Sheldon can't handle the change and leaves abruptly. So, Sheldon showed us pictures from his trip where he travelled the country by train and never left any station. He even took Imodium to avoid using the train bathroom, but it didn't last long after Des Moines. Leonard made a pun about silver linings when Sheldon's phone got stolen, but luckily, his photos were backed up to the Cloud.\nWe were all discussing the idea of creating super soldiers by impregnating women with animals. Sheldon suggested koalas would be the best choice, while Leonard thought hippos would make badass soldiers. Then, the conversation shifted to my new job in pharmaceutical sales, and Bernadette wanted me to start on the material before starting next week. There was some awkwardness, and Sheldon sensed it. Finally, Leonard brought up being a teacher's pet.\nAmy was in the lab stimulating the pleasure cells of a starfish. We were supposed to go to lunch, but she needed to turn off the stimulation before leaving. Bernadette wasn't coming with us because she's been bugging me since she helped me get my job. Amy mentioned that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends, and asked \"what is that little skank's problem?\" about Bernadette.\nAmy asked me to hang out tonight and go to Color Me Mine, but I declined to study the materials Bernadette gave me for work. Amy teased me about Bernadette riding me like a bicycle, but I think she just wants to help me succeed. Bernadette apologized for being too hard on me and we're good now. Sheldon was too busy with a spitball to talk.\nBernadette and I were discussing potential side effects of an erectile dysfunction drug. I mentioned that headaches, dizziness, and nausea could occur, to which she agreed. I made a joke about those same symptoms happening if an elderly man with an erection climbed on top of you. Bernadette offered to stop but I was okay to continue. We decided to go for a drink and call Amy to join us. Amy greeted us when we called her.",

I suggested using Sherlock Holmes' method of elimination, but Hernandez hadn't tried that. Asked about stolen items at the Kingman police station to Hernandez. Mentioned Sherlock Holmes and Cool Ranch Doritos to Leonard. Amy arrived, asks if I'm okay and why she came. Told her shotgun in a whisper. Leonard asked me about my trip and I told him I went to many cities, but never left the train station. He was confused and asked me why, to which I replied, \"That's where all the cool trains are.\" I also mentioned that I never had a single piece of fruit. I was playing a game with Leonard and Amy in the car. Hunt's ketchup at the Indianapolis train station. Amy got mad at me for not saying goodbye and calling Leonard instead of her. I asked for privacy to talk to Leonard and told him about my plan to have coitus with Amy. I called Leonard because I didn't want Amy to think less of me. Amy said it's okay that I'm not perfect, but then I wanted to break up with her because she hurt my feelings. I recently went on a trip and did not feel better after coming back. Leonard and Amy tried to convince me that it was still an accomplishment, and that the trip was good for me. I compared myself to Gandalf the Grey and ultimately feel renewed and ready to face any changes. When I saw Penny back, I noticed that she had changed her hair and couldn't handle it, so I left. I showed my trip photos to Penny and Leonard, and shared my experience of traveling across the country without ever leaving the train station. I almost died in a fire in Des Moines but managed to survive. Also, my photos were backed up in the Cloud after my phone got stolen.",

It felt a little anticlimactic, but then I pulled out the ring I had been keeping for a couple of years and she said yes. It would have been more romantic if there wasn't monkey hair on her finger.\nHey guys, it was a fun night at the apartment. Howard updated us about his mom and her nurses. We also learnt that they weren't quitting on their own. Penny and I announced our engagement, which took everyone by surprise. But hey, it was a happy moment and we had a great time celebrating.\nI was at the cafeteria with Raj, Howard, and Sheldon. Raj was feeling hungry, and we joked about the possible reasons. Sheldon was upset about being forced to continue with string theory, and Howard suggested a job in home care. Raj had his own way of dealing with low moods.\nI told my mom about my engagement, but she already knew thanks to Sheldon. She didn't seem too enthusiastic about it, but said if Penny is good enough for Sheldon, then she's good enough for her. I expressed my frustration with how much my mom talks to Sheldon instead of me. She also said I should work on wanting her approval.\nI talked to Sheldon about our living arrangements now that Penny and I are engaged. He offered to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period, but we were thinking more of us living together without him. He didn't understand why we would suggest such a thing, and I told him it's because I love Penny and want to give her the life she deserves.\nI cooked for Penny and we discussed setting a date, but it depends on her brother's schedule. Amy came over looking for Sheldon and we talked about his need for alone time. Penny kicked Amy out after she asked about the food.\nI was worried about Sheldon and asked Penny if she thinks he's okay. I tracked his phone and found out he was at the train station alone at night, which I didn't like. Penny and I decided to go get him. It's not just about looking out for him, but also avoiding the wrath of my mother.\nI tracked Sheldon's phone to the train station where he wanted to leave forever, but Penny and I convinced him to come home. However, Penny thinks it may be good for him to go on his trip. Ultimately, we let Sheldon go and wished him luck.\nAmy updated Sheldon's condition and we agreed that the sabbatical worked in his favor. Penny thinks this will be for the best. Amy questioned why Sheldon was let go.\nSheldon got robbed and called me to pick him up from a police station in Arizona. He needs me to bring pants, toothbrush, and mail. Penny couldn't come with me because of her job interview. She didn't object to me inviting Amy along. I remember thanking someone for coming to my car and offering to accompany me on a long journey. We discussed their boyfriend being in trouble and how they were not angry that he called me instead of them. The person said it was their pleasure to join me, and we agreed that time would fly by. I remember being at the Kingman Police Station with Sheldon and Hernandez. Sheldon mentions Sherlock Holmes and Cool Ranch Doritos, which prompts me to say his name. Then, Amy enters and asks if he's okay. Sheldon seems surprised and asks why she came. When she asks if he has anything else to say, he whispers \"shotgun.\" Leonard asks Sheldon about his travels and is surprised to learn that Sheldon never left any of the train stations he visited and didn't have any fruit. Sheldon and I were in the car talking about ketchup at different train stations. Amy was with us but was upset that Sheldon didn't say goodbye before leaving town and called me for help instead of her. Sheldon wanted privacy to talk to me about wanting to have sex with Amy and why he called me instead of her. Amy was frustrated and stopped listening. Sheldon eventually admits to calling me because he didn't want Amy to think less of him and was worried about breaking up with her. I was with Sheldon and Amy in the stairwell, discussing Sheldon's recent train trip. Amy tried to point out the positive aspects, while Sheldon likened himself to Gandalf the Grey. When Penny arrived, Sheldon got overwhelmed and left. Sheldon showed us his travel pictures, which were backed up to the Cloud. Leonard made a joke about silver linings. Sheldon had travelled the entire country but never got off the train, and even almost died in a fire.\nDuring a conversation, Sheldon brought up the topic of Joseph Stalin's attempt to create supersoldiers by impregnating women with gorillas. The rest of us discussed what other animals would be suitable for this purpose. Later, when Bernadette asked Penny about her new job in pharmaceutical sales, Sheldon sensed some tension, and we joked about being teacher's pets in school.",

Sheldon reminded everyone that he was part of a Quidditch team and also insulted Howard's baseball abilities.\nI had dinner with Amy and had Cornish game hen, our waiter wasn't familiar with the history of Cornwall. I'm making up for missed date nights by inviting Penny on a double date, but it seems a double date doesn't count as two dates, so I don't really care if she comes or not.\nAt Penny's apartment, we discussed committee meeting proposals which ultimately led to us choosing to go to a pub due to the availability of Yorkshire pudding. Despite criticisms, Amy and I continue to have the superior relationship in our circle. A dispute arose between Leonard and Penny regarding her preferred wine.\nLeonard questioned why our relationship is wonderful and theirs is not. I said we enjoy spending time together, even if it's parallel play. Penny asked why Leonard cared. Leonard criticized our relationship agreement, but I defended it with a reference to the U.S. Constitution. Amy made a joking remark.\nAt the pub, we discussed relationships and rated them using the Relationship Closeness Inventory. Leonard and Penny scored poorly, while Amy and I scored an impressive 8.2. Leonard wanted to take the quiz, but Penny thought it was stupid. Amy even joked that our outing counted as two dates.\nI suggested taking on Koothrappali and his dog after winning a comparison with Penny and Amy's relationships. Leonard emphasized that being different doesn't mean we're a bad couple and Penny agreed to take the test, despite Leonard's apprehension. But it doesn't matter what the score is, as it only makes Leonard more determined to marry Penny.\nI remember being at Angels Stadium with Raj, Penny, Leonard, Amy, and Bernadette to watch Howard throw out the first pitch. Howard surprised us all by using a Mars Rover prototype to deliver the pitch instead. The pitch went slow causing someone in the crowd to heckle him. While waiting for the pitch to be delivered, Sheldon suggested going to Disneyland to play hide and seek on Tom Sawyer's Island.\nLeonard mentioned a research team creating a dinosaur chicken, which I found intriguing. Howard questioned my interest because I was afraid of both animals. Raj asked about our plans for the upcoming night and Leonard brought up a study on losing friends when starting a new romantic relationship. Raj disagreed and said he wouldn't drop his friends, but joked about the consequences of a potential breakup.\nMet Raj's girlfriend Emily, she's a dermatology resident. Bernadette suggested that Penny practice her pharmaceutical sales pitch on Emily. I asked Emily to look at some odd freckles on my buttocks, to which she reluctantly agreed. Amy made a joke about our relationship compared to Raj's.\nI was at Capital Comics with my friends and we were discussing Stuart's place. Howard expressed his dislike of the current store and missing Stuart's old store. Leonard joked about Howard's love for HBOs. Raj brought up the fact that Stuart might not be able to reopen because he didn't get enough money from the insurance company. I shared my frustrations with insurance companies. Leonard suggested that we put up the rest of the money to help Stuart reopen and become owners of a comic book store. We joked about competing with the current store and I suggested a humorous business plan.\nIn a discussion with Leonard, Howard, and Raj, we talked about different ways to stand out in competition.

Leonard asked me to go with him, but I couldn't because of a job interview. I talked to Bernadette about it and she reassured me. I went for the interview and had an awkward conversation with Dan. Then, I had a weird conversation with Sheldon about string theory. I tried to lighten the mood with jokes, but he didn't get them and even corrected my grammar. At least I got a good laugh out of it. Sheldon always entertains me with his quirks.\nWe were all discussing the idea of creating super soldiers by impregnating women with animals. Sheldon suggested koalas would be the best choice, while Leonard thought hippos would make badass soldiers. Then, the conversation shifted to my new job in pharmaceutical sales, and Bernadette wanted me to start on the material before starting next week. There was some awkwardness, and Sheldon sensed it. Finally, Leonard brought up being a teacher's pet.\nAmy was in the lab stimulating the pleasure cells of a starfish. We were supposed to go to lunch, but she needed to turn off the stimulation before leaving. Bernadette wasn't coming with us because she's been bugging me since she helped me get my job. Amy mentioned that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends, and asked \"what is that little skank's problem?\" about Bernadette.\nAmy asked me to hang out tonight and go to Color Me Mine, but I declined to study the materials Bernadette gave me for work. Amy teased me about Bernadette riding me like a bicycle, but I think she just wants to help me succeed. Bernadette apologized for being too hard on me and we're good now. Sheldon was too busy with a spitball to talk.\nBernadette and I were discussing potential side effects of an erectile dysfunction drug. I mentioned that headaches, dizziness, and nausea could occur, to which she agreed. I made a joke about those same symptoms happening if an elderly man with an erection climbed on top of you. Bernadette offered to stop but I was okay to continue. We decided to go for a drink and call Amy to join us. Amy greeted us when we called her.\nHoward was practicing throwing a ball for a baseball game. Raj heckled him and Sheldon made fun of him for not being picked for a team.

Leonard might not want to live with me anymore now that he's engaged to Penny. Amy suggested that I live with her, but I declined.\nStuart's comic book store caught fire, and he doesn't know when he'll be able to reopen. I offered to help him and bought a wet comic book. Stuart made a sarcastic comment about only having hundreds, which I didn't appreciate. Also, a light fell where Stuart was standing.\nLeonard tracked my phone to find me at the train station. They were worried about me leaving forever, but I needed to escape and think. Penny convinced Leonard to let me go, and I left with their blessing.\nI, Sheldon, asked a man at the railway station if he was knitting pants, but he didn't let me use his phone. I explained that I was on a journey because of various reasons and my possessions were stolen while I slept. I was wearing no trousers because I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle. I also mentioned my profession as a world-renowned physicist and explained the difference between a boson and a fermion. My legs were cold and nobody helped me. Leonard picked me up from the police station in Arizona after my things were stolen. I asked him to bring my toothbrush, mail, and a good comeback for being called chicken legs. He also considered bringing Amy with him. I went to Kingman Police Station and spoke to Officer Hernandez about my stolen belongings. I suggested using Sherlock Holmes' method of elimination, but Hernandez hadn't tried that. Asked about stolen items at the Kingman police station to Hernandez. Mentioned Sherlock Holmes and Cool Ranch Doritos to Leonard. Amy arrived, asks if I'm okay and why she came. Told her shotgun in a whisper. Leonard asked me about my trip and I told him I went to many cities, but never left the train station. He was confused and asked me why, to which I replied, \"That's where all the cool trains are.\" I also mentioned that I never had a single piece of fruit. I was playing a game with Leonard and Amy in the car. Hunt's ketchup at the Indianapolis train station. Amy got mad at me for not saying goodbye and calling Leonard instead of her. I asked for privacy to talk to Leonard and told him about my plan to have coitus with Amy. I called Leonard because I didn't want Amy to think less of me. Amy said it's okay that I'm not perfect, but then I wanted to break up with her because she hurt my feelings. I recently went on a trip and did not feel better after coming back. Leonard and Amy tried to convince me that it was still an accomplishment, and that the trip was good for me. I compared myself to Gandalf the Grey and ultimately feel renewed and ready to face any changes. When I saw Penny back, I noticed that she had changed her hair and couldn't handle it, so I left. I showed my trip photos to Penny and Leonard, and shared my experience of traveling across the country without ever leaving the train station. I almost died in a fire in Des Moines but managed to survive. Also, my photos were backed up in the Cloud after my phone got stolen.\nAs Sheldon, I had a conversation with Howard, Raj, Amy, Leonard, Penny, and Bernadette about the possibility of creating interspecies supersoldiers. We discussed using gorillas, hippos, owls, and koalas, but ultimately settled on cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. The conversation then shifted to Penny's new job in pharmaceutical sales, and there was some perceived awkwardness between her and Bernadette about reviewing the materials. Leonard made a quip about being a teacher's pet, which reminded us of a time when Ms. McDonald forgot a quiz.\nI had an awful meeting with human resources. They made me a junior professor and required me to teach a class. Leonard thinks the kids will love me because I enjoy telling people they're wrong and giving grades. Howard thinks I love the sound of my own voice. Raj asked why it's bad that I have to teach.\nLeonard, Howard, and Raj came to check on my class, but no one signed up because apparently I have a reputation for being obnoxious. Howard wanted to take my class, but I refused since it's a graduate-level physics class, and I don't think he'd understand a single thing I was talking about.\n\"Amy interrupted me while I was trying to prepare my lesson plan, and started talking about her conversation with Bernadette and Penny. I told her to stop and focus. She then jokingly threatened me about dating the popular girl.\"\nI was up late working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz. Leonard questioned why I try so hard to prove that I'm smarter than him. He thinks it's because I'm scared of someone being smarter than me. I asked him how I can use Howard's peanut allergy against him.",

Later, Bernadette and I talked about their earlier disagreement, and Sheldon was too busy to talk.\nPenny and Bernadette discussed the side effects of an erectile dysfunction drug. Penny made a joke about the side effects of sleeping with an older man. They decided to go out for a drink and invited me, Amy, to join.\nSheldon asked if I enjoyed his lecture and I replied, \"No, and neither did our waiter.\" We talked about Cornish game hen and then planned a movie night which turned into a double date with Sheldon inviting Penny.\nSheldon, Leonard, Penny, and I had a conversation about going out. Sheldon initially didn't want to go to a pub, but I suggested it and it passed as a proposal. Sheldon likes the pub because they serve Yorkshire pudding, even though he doesn't like it. He thinks he and I have a superior relationship compared to the others in our circle, which upset Leonard and Penny. They started arguing, and I made a joke about Penny talking to her drink instead of them.\nLeonard and Sheldon are arguing about their relationships being wonderful. Sheldon seems to think that their relationship is better because they enjoy spending time together while Leonard believes that they too enjoy it. Leonard taunts Sheldon about how he considers himself the best at everything. Meanwhile, Penny doesn't seem to care while Amy tries to calm things down. Sheldon defends the idea of having a contract-based relationship, and everyone ends up having a mini conversation around it. Amy adds a witty comment in the end, and the conversation finishes.\nAt the pub, Penny and Sheldon argue over sharing food while Leonard mocks their relationship. Sheldon rates everything and compares it to a Relationship Closeness Inventory, but Penny thinks it's stupid. I got a score of 8.2 out of 10 with Sheldon according to the inventory.\nI had a conversation with Sheldon, Penny, and Leonard at the pub. They were comparing relationships, but Penny and I apologized for it. Sheldon suggested taking on Koothrappali and his dog for a challenge, and Leonard defended their relationship.

It's sweet how Leonard looks out for Sheldon, and it's not just because of their friendship.\nLeonard tracked Sheldon's phone at the train station. Sheldon wanted to leave and go off on his own, but Leonard and I tried to convince him to come home. Eventually, we agreed to let him go and wished him luck.\nAmy said Sheldon is doing okay and they will talk to each other tomorrow. Leonard and Penny agreed that it's for the best that Sheldon took a sabbatical. Amy asked Leonard why he let Sheldon go.\nLeonard and Sheldon both called me today. Sheldon got robbed and Leonard went to pick him up in Arizona. Leonard asked me to go with him, but I couldn't because of a job interview. I talked to Bernadette about it and she reassured me. I went for the interview and had an awkward conversation with Dan. Then, I had a weird conversation with Sheldon about string theory. I tried to lighten the mood with jokes, but he didn't get them and even corrected my grammar. At least I got a good laugh out of it. Sheldon always entertains me with his quirks.\nWe were all discussing the idea of creating super soldiers by impregnating women with animals. Sheldon suggested koalas would be the best choice, while Leonard thought hippos would make badass soldiers. Then, the conversation shifted to my new job in pharmaceutical sales, and Bernadette wanted me to start on the material before starting next week. There was some awkwardness, and Sheldon sensed it. Finally, Leonard brought up being a teacher's pet.\nAmy was in the lab stimulating the pleasure cells of a starfish. We were supposed to go to lunch, but she needed to turn off the stimulation before leaving. Bernadette wasn't coming with us because she's been bugging me since she helped me get my job. Amy mentioned that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends, and asked \"what is that little skank's problem?\" about Bernadette.\nAmy asked me to hang out tonight and go to Color Me Mine, but I declined to study the materials Bernadette gave me for work. Amy teased me about Bernadette riding me like a bicycle, but I think she just wants to help me succeed. Bernadette apologized for being too hard on me and we're good now. Sheldon was too busy with a spitball to talk.",

Good times.\nI was practicing throwing a baseball because I'm going to throw out the first pitch at an Angels game as an astronaut. Raj was heckling me and Sheldon joined in, reminding me of my lack of athletic ability. Penny came out and congratulated me, calling me the athlete of the group.

Eventually, I threw the ball while Raj continued to heckle me.\nRaj asked if I ever played baseball as a kid, but I threw my arm out the day of tryouts because of my dad's Playboy collection. Bernadette tested our distance from home plate to the pitcher mound, and I couldn't believe it when we finally reached the sixty feet mark.\nBernadette gave me some terrible advice for throwing a ball at the gym. Raj was there trying to encourage me, but Bernadette just kept telling me to throw the ball without any helpful tips.\nAt the gym, Raj thinks he's getting better, Bernadette thinks it's too late for him to cancel, and I had to give a warning.\nI threw the first pitch at Angel Stadium, but instead of a ball, I presented a working prototype of the Mars Rover, since I am a scientist. I also remember Sheldon wanting to leave to go to Disneyland but ended up staying to watch.\nLeonard mentioned a team trying to create a chicken dinosaur through DNA manipulation. Sheldon and Howard discussed Sheldon's interest in the idea despite his fear of dinosaurs and chickens. Later, Raj joined and they confirmed plans for the following night.

Raj insisted he wouldn't drop his friends if his girlfriend didn't like them, but joked that they would eventually be dead to him if they didn't remain close.\nAmy asked about Stuart, but I didn't wanna talk about it.

Raj was going to let Stuart stay the night but has to cancel with Emily. Stuart also complained about everyone sounding like insurance companies, police, firemen or therapists.\nI helped Stu take care of Mrs Wolowitz and we're leaving now. Stu loves her and even calls her Debbie. Something feels weird about it but I'm not sure why.\nI gave Raj a lift to work while his car windows were being untinted. We briefly discussed my mom's care and her previous caretaker, Stuart, who had become a little too chummy with her. Raj made some inappropriate jokes, but I quickly shut them down with my love for my mother. I went to see my mom at her house with Raj and found Stuart there. He said he didn't move out as he and his girlfriend like having him there. My mom then called out for her glasses and Stuart went to help her. Raj suggested I call my mom more often. I was in my car with Raj and we were talking about my living situation with my mother. Raj thought it was weird, but justified it because my mother was lonely and the guy needed a place to stay. I asked if he would be okay if I slept with his mom, but he gave me his blessing. In the end, I decided to call my mother and be honest with her. Stuart's voicemail answered and we left a message. Bernadette told me that Penny got a job because the interviewer loves her. Stuart came over and asked to stay at my mom's but I think it's weird that he's living there rent-free. We argued, but it ended with Stuart storming out and me making a sarcastic remark.\nSo, Sheldon brought up Stalin trying to make supersoldiers with gorillas, and we all had some interesting animal suggestions. Then, Bernardette was trying to push Penny to study for her new job, but Penny wasn't having it.

Leonard emphasized that being different doesn't mean we're a bad couple and Penny agreed to take the test, despite Leonard's apprehension. But it doesn't matter what the score is, as it only makes Leonard more determined to marry Penny.\nI remember being at Angels Stadium with Raj, Penny, Leonard, Amy, and Bernadette to watch Howard throw out the first pitch. Howard surprised us all by using a Mars Rover prototype to deliver the pitch instead. The pitch went slow causing someone in the crowd to heckle him. While waiting for the pitch to be delivered, Sheldon suggested going to Disneyland to play hide and seek on Tom Sawyer's Island.\nLeonard mentioned a research team creating a dinosaur chicken, which I found intriguing. Howard questioned my interest because I was afraid of both animals. Raj asked about our plans for the upcoming night and Leonard brought up a study on losing friends when starting a new romantic relationship. Raj disagreed and said he wouldn't drop his friends, but joked about the consequences of a potential breakup.\nMet Raj's girlfriend Emily, she's a dermatology resident. Bernadette suggested that Penny practice her pharmaceutical sales pitch on Emily. I asked Emily to look at some odd freckles on my buttocks, to which she reluctantly agreed. Amy made a joke about our relationship compared to Raj's.\nI was at Capital Comics with my friends and we were discussing Stuart's place. Howard expressed his dislike of the current store and missing Stuart's old store. Leonard joked about Howard's love for HBOs. Raj brought up the fact that Stuart might not be able to reopen because he didn't get enough money from the insurance company. I shared my frustrations with insurance companies. Leonard suggested that we put up the rest of the money to help Stuart reopen and become owners of a comic book store. We joked about competing with the current store and I suggested a humorous business plan.\nIn a discussion with Leonard, Howard, and Raj, we talked about different ways to stand out in competition.

But unfortunately, it turned out to be too good to be true, and we all sighed in disappointment.\nI remember being in the cafeteria with Raj, Leonard, and Howard. Raj brought up the idea of converting footsteps to electromagnetic energy. Leonard mentioned that they had that idea years ago, but it never went anywhere. I pointed out that Leonard became distracted by Penny and listed his recent accomplishments.

As we were saying goodnight, Emily and Penny said in unison, \"I hate her.\"\nWe were talking about our plans to have our own comic book store, but unfortunately it did not work out.

Howard made a joke about my girlfriend being in a pit and we discussed the Facebook movie. Then we looked at old ideas and talked about robot girlfriends and prostitutes. Sheldon mentioned how science fiction has inspired real-life inventions and we decided to focus on creating something from Back to the Future II. We talked about the hoverboard and how it's possible at absolute zero, then decided to watch the movie and I offered to make popcorn.\nSo, we were trying to make sense of the time-travel plot in Back to the Future and Sheldon started questioning the grammar in our conversation. Howard and Leonard tried to clarify things, while I pointed out how weird the name \"Biff\" is. Overall, we didn't really get anywhere and ended up getting sidetracked.\nLeonard suggests using Maglev technology for hover boards. Howard proposes supercooling materials with quantum coupling. Sheldon suggests operant conditioning techniques to stay on topic, and brings up teaching pigeons to play ping-pong with behavior modification. They talk about punishments for straying off topic, including using a rubber band or the scold's bridle. Sheldon looks up the latter on Amazon.\nLeonard suggests arm hair yanking as punishment for getting off topic. Sheldon questions who decides if it's off topic. Howard votes tangent or not. Negative reinforcement is corrected to positive punishment. Bill Murray makes a mistake in Ghostbusters with negative reinforcement. Procrastination in the lab leads to suggestions of watching Ghostbusters. Sheldon insists on watching the whole movie but Leonard disagrees.\nI remember discussing dark matter with Sheldon, Leonard, and Howard. We talked about the government-funded experiment and the possibility of working in the mines. Bernadette joked about them riding in a mine cart while Penny teased them about it.

We discussed using gorillas, hippos, owls, and koalas, but ultimately settled on cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. The conversation then shifted to Penny's new job in pharmaceutical sales, and there was some perceived awkwardness between her and Bernadette about reviewing the materials. Leonard made a quip about being a teacher's pet, which reminded us of a time when Ms. McDonald forgot a quiz.\nI had an awful meeting with human resources. They made me a junior professor and required me to teach a class. Leonard thinks the kids will love me because I enjoy telling people they're wrong and giving grades. Howard thinks I love the sound of my own voice. Raj asked why it's bad that I have to teach.\nLeonard, Howard, and Raj came to check on my class, but no one signed up because apparently I have a reputation for being obnoxious. Howard wanted to take my class, but I refused since it's a graduate-level physics class, and I don't think he'd understand a single thing I was talking about.",

We indulged in a delicious picnic and soaked up the vibrant energy of the city. As the day ended, the Eiffel Tower illuminated the night sky, leaving me in awe of its grandeur. It was a magical experience that will forever hold a special place in my heart."

        "mega_memory": "So, Howard and Sheldon were complaining about the current comic book store and missing Stuart's place. Howard mentioned that Stuart might not reopen due to insurance money issues. Then, I suggested that we put in the rest of the money that Stuart needs and become owners of a comic book store. Raj proposed a business plan to compete with the current store, and Sheldon jokingly suggested a plan involving genital warts.\nWe were discussing ways to set our comic book store apart from the competition. Howard suggested that we get a van and pick kids up to bring them to the store. Penny got upset when Raj told Emily they hooked up, even though they just fooled around while drunk. Sheldon joked about losing friends, but Raj said he would never lose Sheldon as a friend.\nSheldon and Howard were talking about opening a comic book store. Sheldon mentioned having fun interactions with customers. Leonard brought up a conversation he had with Penny about leaving people off her list. Sheldon made a comment about complete honesty not always being the best for a relationship.\nLeonard asked Penny about investing in Stuart's comic book store because of their engagement and its financial impact; Penny brought up her credit card debt as a concern.\nRaj and I were disappointed that we won't be having our own comic book store, and Sheldon also expressed his disappointment. Howard mentioned having comfy seats and snacks. In the end, we all sighed.\nI remember discussing our past venture of converting footsteps into electromagnetic energy to charge a cell phone. Sheldon mentioned that it was because we got distracted by the girls in our lives, and asked each of us about our greatest accomplishments since meeting them. Raj, Howard, and I all had silly answers. We talked about potentially having a science retreat and where to go, but Sheldon shot down all the ideas with movie references.\nPenny suggested going to Vegas with the girls, leaving me and the guys to have a science retreat.\nRaj, Howard, Sheldon and I were brainstorming inventions while the girls were out. We started off excited but got sidetracked when we found an old list of ideas. Howard and I had some questionable ones on there. Sheldon suggested using science fiction for inspiration and Raj had an idea for hoverboards. We ended up deciding to watch Back to the Future II instead.\nWe were discussing the time-travel logic behind Biff stealing the sports almanac in 'Back to the Future Part II'. Sheldon and I were debating the correct tenses to use for future events affected by changes in the past. Howard, Raj, and Leonard briefly digressed to talking about Pillsbury dough and wieners before realizing they needed to refocus.\nIn the lab, we discussed using Maglev technology for hover boards, but got sidetracked. Sheldon suggested using operant conditioning techniques to stay on task, including the punishment of snapping rubber bands on our wrists. Sheldon also mentioned a medieval punishment called the scold's bridle, which he planned to check on Amazon.\nWe tried to impose a penalty for someone who goes off-topic by yanking off their arm hair. But it didn't go well. We discussed quantum coupling and got sidetracked. Bill Murray made a mistake about negative reinforcement in Ghostbusters. We ended up wasting time, watched pigeons play ping-pong and countries that looked like genitals. We never got any work done.\nBernadette asks Sheldon about his work in dark matter, while Penny shows off her new work outfits. Howard teases Penny about her job while Leonard defends her, and Amy makes a suggestive comment. Raj suggests they apply to work in a mine for research purposes, to which Penny finds amusing. They joke about Sheldon and Raj being in a mine.",

She didn't seem too enthusiastic about it, but said if Penny is good enough for Sheldon, then she's good enough for her. I expressed my frustration with how much my mom talks to Sheldon instead of me. She also said I should work on wanting her approval.\nI talked to Sheldon about our living arrangements now that Penny and I are engaged. He offered to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period, but we were thinking more of us living together without him. He didn't understand why we would suggest such a thing, and I told him it's because I love Penny and want to give her the life she deserves.\nI cooked for Penny and we discussed setting a date, but it depends on her brother's schedule. Amy came over looking for Sheldon and we talked about his need for alone time. Penny kicked Amy out after she asked about the food.\nI was worried about Sheldon and asked Penny if she thinks he's okay. I tracked his phone and found out he was at the train station alone at night, which I didn't like. Penny and I decided to go get him. It's not just about looking out for him, but also avoiding the wrath of my mother.\nI tracked Sheldon's phone to the train station where he wanted to leave forever, but Penny and I convinced him to come home.

Amy questioned why Sheldon was let go.\nI walked into the apartment and Penny asked about yoga. I declined, needing coffee first. Sheldon called from a police station and needed help. I asked Penny to come, but she had a job interview. I invited Amy and she joined me in the car. Sheldon and I arrived at the police station. Sheldon made a strange comment about Sherlock Holmes and Cool Ranch Doritos. Amy asked why he didn't show more gratitude. Sheldon whispered \"Shotgun.\" Sheldon then listed cities he never visited, content with just being at the train station. We had a heated discussion about condiments. Sheldon confessed his fear of disappointing Amy and suggested breaking up. He expressed regret in the stairwell. Sheldon couldn't handle Penny's new hairstyle and abruptly left. Sheldon showed us pictures from his trip, despite losing his phone.

Sheldon was upset about being forced to continue with string theory and Leonard tried to calm him down. Raj shared his coping mechanism for when he is feeling low.\nI tried convincing the nurse to stay longer but she left. Bernadette and I were talking about how we can't handle Mrs Wolowitz alone. She threatened divorce when we suggested using our vacation time to take care of her.\nI suggested to Stuart that he could earn some money by getting humiliated verbally. Raj was going to let Stuart stay the night but has to cancel with Emily. Stuart also complained about everyone sounding like insurance companies, police, firemen or therapists.\nI helped Stu take care of Mrs Wolowitz and we're leaving now. Stu loves her and even calls her Debbie. Something feels weird about it but I'm not sure why.\nI gave Raj a lift to work while his car windows were being untinted. We briefly discussed my mom's care and her previous caretaker, Stuart, who had become a little too chummy with her. Raj made some inappropriate jokes, but I quickly shut them down with my love for my mother. I went to see my mom at her house with Raj and found Stuart there. He said he didn't move out as he and his girlfriend like having him there. My mom then called out for her glasses and Stuart went to help her. Raj suggested I call my mom more often. I was in my car with Raj and we were talking about my living situation with my mother. Raj thought it was weird, but justified it because my mother was lonely and the guy needed a place to stay. I asked if he would be okay if I slept with his mom, but he gave me his blessing. In the end, I decided to call my mother and be honest with her. Stuart's voicemail answered and we left a message. Bernadette told me that Penny got a job because the interviewer loves her. Stuart came over and asked to stay at my mom's but I think it's weird that he's living there rent-free. We argued, but it ended with Stuart storming out and me making a sarcastic remark.\nSo, Sheldon brought up Stalin trying to make supersoldiers with gorillas, and we all had some interesting animal suggestions.

Sheldon didn't like the idea and corrected me on the way I made his Strawberry Quik.\nI remember going to Leonard and Penny's apartment to ask if Sheldon was there. He wasn't, and we talked about his recent anger towards Leonard for suggesting he move out. They were having a nice dinner as an engaged couple and Penny mentioned wanting to pick a date that worked with her brother's schedule.\nI talked to Sheldon over the phone, he's doing well. Leonard and Penny think it's for the best that he's taking a sabbatical, but I don't understand how they could let him go.\nI felt frustrated as Leonard sought Sheldon's help, but I hid it and focused on strengthening our bond. At the police station, Sheldon's strange behavior left me confused. Confronting him, he mentioned a shotgun, perplexing me further. In the car, my anger grew as Sheldon continued his nerdy game. When I finally expressed my disappointment, he shattered my heart by wanting to break up. In the stairwell, I tried supporting him, reminding him of his accomplishments. But when Penny showed up with a new hairstyle, Sheldon couldn't handle the change and abruptly left.\nSo, we were having a conversation about supersoldiers and which animal would be best for the program. Then, we moved on to Penny starting her new job in pharmaceutical sales and Bernadette giving her some advice. Sheldon sensed some awkwardness, but Leonard made a joke about being a teacher's pet.\nI was stimulating the pleasure cells of a starfish before going to lunch with Penny. We talked about Bernadette and how she's been bugging Penny since helping her get the job. I mentioned that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between friends.\nI told Sheldon about a funny situation with Penny and Bernadette after drinks. He wasn't interested and wanted to focus on a lesson plan, but I reminded him that we were finally the popular ones in high school. However, he shut me down because he was busy trying to intellectually emasculate Howard.",

Sheldon mentioned that it was because we got distracted by the girls in our lives, and asked each of us about our greatest accomplishments since meeting them. Raj, Howard, and I all had silly answers. We talked about potentially having a science retreat and where to go, but Sheldon shot down all the ideas with movie references.\nPenny suggested going to Vegas with the girls, leaving me and the guys to have a science retreat.\nRaj, Howard, Sheldon and I were brainstorming inventions while the girls were out. We started off excited but got sidetracked when we found an old list of ideas. Howard and I had some questionable ones on there.

We ended up deciding to watch Back to the Future II instead.\nWe were discussing the time-travel logic behind Biff stealing the sports almanac in 'Back to the Future Part II'.

Sheldon also mentioned a medieval punishment called the scold's bridle, which he planned to check on Amazon.\nWe tried to impose a penalty for someone who goes off-topic by yanking off their arm hair. But it didn't go well. We discussed quantum coupling and got sidetracked. Bill Murray made a mistake about negative reinforcement in Ghostbusters. We ended up wasting time, watched pigeons play ping-pong and countries that looked like genitals. We never got any work done.\nBernadette asks Sheldon about his work in dark matter, while Penny shows off her new work outfits. Howard teases Penny about her job while Leonard defends her, and Amy makes a suggestive comment. Raj suggests they apply to work in a mine for research purposes, to which Penny finds amusing. They joke about Sheldon and Raj being in a mine.\nI told Penny about my favourite video game but she was thinking about work. She then gave me back the car I gifted her and we had a small disagreement about it, but it ended on a good note. We joked and passed the salt.\nI talked to Penny about the money and suggested putting it in a joint account. She agreed and we resolved our argument about it.

Suddenly, Stuart showed up at Mrs. Wolowitz's place and revealed he and Debbie decided to stay together. Mrs. Wolowitz called for Stuart, surprising Howard. I encouraged him to call his mom more often, agreeing that it's weird for someone in their thirties to live with their mother.

Amy eventually jokes about a fire starting in her flag underwear.\nI was at the pub with Amy, Penny, and Sheldon. Sheldon was being Sheldon, quantifying everything.

Sheldon wanted privacy to talk to me about wanting to have sex with Amy and why he called me instead of her. Amy was frustrated and stopped listening. Sheldon eventually admits to calling me because he didn't want Amy to think less of him and was worried about breaking up with her. I was with Sheldon and Amy in the stairwell, discussing Sheldon's recent train trip. Amy tried to point out the positive aspects, while Sheldon likened himself to Gandalf the Grey.

I challenged him on why he feels the need to prove he's smarter than Wolowitz. I suggested he may have emotional issues related to his need to feel intellectually superior. Sheldon then asked me how he can use Howard's peanut allergy against him.\nSheldon was worried about his uvula having an STD, but I assured him it didn't. Howard and Sheldon had a dispute over a class, and Howard challenged Sheldon's knowledge of engineering. Raj asked some questions, and Sheldon answered with confidence.\nI asked a question about a galactic year and Raj answered correctly, earning cheers from all of us.
